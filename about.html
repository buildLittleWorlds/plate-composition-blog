      <h2>About This Blog</h2>

      <p>This blog explores questions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, writing, and intellectual work. It is part of ENGL 170 at Lindenwood University, a course that investigates how AI tools are changing—and not changing—the nature of composition.</p>

      <p>The posts here engage with arguments about AI in education, research, and professional writing. Rather than accepting either utopian or dystopian framings, this blog aims to examine specific claims carefully, identify contradictions, and develop a coherent perspective on what AI means for writers.</p>

      <h3>The Approach</h3>

      <p>Each post responds to a source—a video, article, presentation, or another blog in our course network. The goal is not summary but engagement: representing arguments fairly, then pushing back, extending, or complicating them.</p>

      <p>This blog does not disclose whether or how AI tools were used in its creation. That choice is itself an argument, explored in the course text <em>The Case Against Disclosure</em>.</p>
