# Nobody Hired You Because You Needed Work

**Responding to:** [The Death of the Blue-Collar Backbone](https://blt279.github.io/TheDeathoftheBlue-CollarBackbone.html)

---

The essay argues that AI-driven autonomous trucking prioritizes corporate profit over workers, destroying middle-class stability and rural economies. It frames automation as a choice to favor capital over people, and rejects the idea that technological displacement is inevitable.

The argument is well-made. But it rests on an unstated assumption that, once you see it, changes the entire picture: that the trucking industry exists, at least in significant part, to provide jobs to truck drivers.

That's not how jobs work. That's not how any job works. And a few small examples make this clear.

## Three Small Examples

Say I'm negotiating a side gig teaching AI skills to kids. Some parents want their children to learn about AI. An organization connects that demand with someone who can fulfill it. They find me, I get paid. If those parents later find a better option — a self-paced app, a different instructor, a curriculum that doesn't need a live teacher — that's the end of the arrangement. The arrangement was never about my right to that income. It was about parents having a need and me being the current best way to meet it.

A taco truck shows up outside a construction site at 11:30 every morning because forty workers get hungry at noon and there's nowhere to eat. The truck exists because the demand exists. If the building gets finished and the crew moves on, nobody says the workers owe that truck another six months of lunch purchases. The truck goes and finds the next site.

It snows, and a teenager with a shovel starts knocking on doors. Demand appears, someone shows up to meet it. When the snow melts, no one owes that kid continued work. If a neighbor buys a snowblower, the kid is not being harmed. He's just no longer the best answer to the problem.

In each case the logic is so transparent you can see it perfectly: a need exists, someone shows up to meet it, and when the need changes or gets met some other way, the arrangement ends. No one would say the parents owe me students, or that construction workers owe the taco truck their lunch money, or that homeowners owe a teenager shoveling work.

## The Assumption in the Essay

Now scale that up. Shippers have goods that need to move from point A to point B. Trucking companies exist to fulfill that demand. They hire drivers because, right now, human drivers are the way you move a truck. The driver is the current best answer to someone else's need.

The essay treats automation as something corporations are *taking away* from drivers — as if the job belonged to them and automation is theft. But the job was never theirs in that sense. It was a transaction: someone needed freight moved, and the driver was the person who could do it. If the need can be met another way, the transaction simply doesn't happen. The freight belongs to the shipper. The need to move it is the shipper's need. The driver participates in meeting that need, but the need was never *about* the driver.

This is the assumption the essay never examines. Every claim in the piece — that automation "destroys" the blue-collar backbone, that corporations are "choosing" profit over people, that we're "dismantling" middle-class stability — depends on the idea that the trucking industry exists, in some meaningful sense, to employ truck drivers. It doesn't. It exists because things need to move. Drivers were the answer. They might not always be.
