## Newsletter's Thesis

AI coding workflows—specifically "plan mode" where the AI explores context and produces a plan before executing—offer a model for AI-assisted writing and research. The key insight: AI tools are powerful but stateless, and explicit planning phases help both human and AI avoid wasted effort. Planning isn't overhead; it's where the real thinking happens.

## Opposing View to Refute

### Primary Opponent: Ted Chiang
- **His claim**: "Using ChatGPT undermines education's purpose by enabling students to avoid the mental exertion necessary for intellectual growth." Writing with AI means skipping the thinking that makes writing valuable.
- **Why it's wrong**: Plan mode demonstrates that AI-assisted work doesn't remove thinking—it relocates it. The planning phase IS the thinking. Matt Pocock describes it as "rubber ducking" where requirements get clarified through dialogue. The mental exertion happens in planning; execution becomes straightforward once you've done the cognitive work.

### Additional Opponents (if relevant)
- **"Vibe coding" critics**: Those who worry AI users just accept whatever the tool produces. Plan mode is explicitly designed to prevent this—you can't execute until you've reviewed and approved the plan.

## Recommended Structure

### 1. Opening Hook (~100 words)
Lead with the paradox: a self-described "AI skeptic" (Matt Pocock) now can't work without AI, specifically because of a feature that *prevents* the AI from doing anything until a plan exists. The skeptic's conversion came not from AI getting smarter, but from a workflow that forced thinking first.

### 2. Fair Representation (~200 words)
Present Chiang's view accurately: writing is cognitive training; the value is in the mental exertion, not the output. Using AI to write is like using a calculator before you understand arithmetic—you get answers but lose the capacity to think. For Chiang, there's no version of AI-assisted writing that preserves what matters about writing.

### 3. The Refutation (~300 words)
Plan mode directly contradicts Chiang's assumption that AI assistance means skipping thinking. The workflow forces you to think *before* executing:
- You describe what you want (requirement articulation)
- The AI asks clarifying questions (you must answer them thoughtfully)
- You review the plan and decide if it's right (evaluation and judgment)
- Only then does execution happen

The thinking didn't disappear—it moved to a different phase. Pocock's point about "rubber ducking" is key: the planning dialogue clarifies your own requirements to yourself.

### 4. Development (~400 words)
Extend to writing/research contexts:
- Research: AI can explore sources and propose a structure, but you decide what question matters and whether the framing is right
- Drafting: AI can execute a plan, but the plan requires you to know what you're arguing
- The "colleague who forgets everything" metaphor: you wouldn't let that colleague just start working without a plan; same principle applies

Why the coding→writing analogy holds: both involve turning intent into artifact. The planning phase is where intent gets clarified. Execution is translation.

### 5. Why This Matters (~150 words)
Stakes: Chiang's view, if accepted, means any AI assistance in writing is cognitive decline. But plan mode suggests a different possibility—workflows that preserve and even enhance thinking while gaining efficiency in execution. The question isn't "AI or no AI" but "what workflow?"

### 6. Conclusion (~100 words)
Chiang is right that thinking matters. He's wrong that AI assistance necessarily removes it. Plan mode is evidence that the relationship between tool and thinking is a design choice, not a fixed property of the technology.

1. Read the Ted Chiang transcript for exact quotes to engage with
2. Draft in plate-blog using the template structure
3. Ensure fair representation of Chiang's view before refuting it
