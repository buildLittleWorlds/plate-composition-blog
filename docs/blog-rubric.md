# Blog Post Evaluation Rubric

## Overview

Each post should be 750-1500 words. Language should be direct and concrete—no jargon, no filler. Every sentence should do work.

---

## Criteria

### 1. Fair Representation (20 points)

Does the post accurately represent the source before disagreeing with it?

- **18-20**: The source's argument is presented so clearly that someone who agrees with the source would say "yes, that's what I mean."
- **14-17**: The argument is presented accurately but may oversimplify or miss nuances.
- **10-13**: Some misrepresentation or strawmanning of the source's position.
- **0-9**: The source is mischaracterized or dismissed without engagement.

### 2. Quality of Critique (25 points)

Does the post identify a genuine weakness in the source's argument?

- **22-25**: The critique identifies a real problem—a logical gap, unsupported assumption, overlooked counterexample, or contradiction.
- **17-21**: The critique is valid but could be stronger or more specific.
- **12-16**: The critique is more assertion than argument, or attacks a weak version of the source's point.
- **0-11**: The disagreement is based on preference rather than reasoning.

### 3. Use of Evidence (20 points)

Does the post support its claims with specifics?

- **18-20**: Direct quotations from the source, concrete examples, or reference to relevant precedents (historical, legal, practical).
- **14-17**: Some evidence but could be more specific or better integrated.
- **10-13**: Claims are made but not supported.
- **0-9**: Mostly assertion without grounding.

### 4. Connection to Blog Themes (15 points)

Does the post connect to the blog's ongoing concerns?

- **13-15**: The post explicitly connects to themes of AI disclosure, the nature of creative work, or historical patterns of technology anxiety.
- **10-12**: Some connection but not fully developed.
- **6-9**: The post stands alone without connecting to broader arguments.
- **0-5**: No connection to the blog's perspective.

### 5. Clarity and Economy (20 points)

Is the writing clear and efficient?

- **18-20**: Every paragraph advances the argument. No jargon. No filler phrases ("It is important to note that..."). Sentences are varied but not showy.
- **14-17**: Mostly clear but some unnecessary repetition or vagueness.
- **10-13**: Readable but padded or unclear in places.
- **0-9**: Difficult to follow or bloated with filler.

- Over 1500 words: Deduct 5 points (likely needs tightening)
