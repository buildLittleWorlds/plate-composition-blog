Video Title: AI's Energy & Water Demands: Sorting Fact from Fiction with Andy Masley

TRANSCRIPT:

Hello and welcome back to the cognitive revolution. Today my guest is Andy Maisley, a blogger and thinker who's done some of the best recent independent analysis of the energy and water demands associated with AI. Andy is the director of effective altruism Washington DC and this conversation served as a great reminder of why I appreciate the EA community. Their emphasis on identifying causes that are neglected, tractable, and large in scale seems right on to me. and the culture of epistemic humility and earnest truth seeeking is genuinely admirable. What's more, Andy is a great example of how EA <2>
thinkers are generally very progress, even as they worry about extreme risks from AI. A consistent pattern in my experience which contradicts the popular doomer caricature. In all sincerity, the main reason I've never gone around calling myself an EA is simply because I don't consider myself virtuous enough to deserve the label. But regardless of affiliation, this conversation also demonstrates how a genuinely curious, truth-seeking, numerate person can, with AI help, make a meaningful contribution to the discourse on a complicated topic, even without formal credentials or deep experience. In this <3>
conversation, we tackle the prevailing narratives around AI's consumption of energy and water. While we acknowledge that there can be local issues associated with large-scale data centers that really do matter to specific communities such that local leaders should be careful about the deals they strike with data center companies. The bottom line is that AI is not a huge deal when it comes to global emissions or water use. The main reason is simply that bits really are that much less massive and therefore easier to manipulate than atoms. For the purposes of quick mental math, I find it helpful to <4>
remember a few key heruristics that we develop in this conversation. A single chat GPT query uses roughly as much energy as running a microwave for 1 second. A single cross town car trip, a hamburger, and a hot shower all use roughly as much energy as 10,000 Jad GBT queries. Which means that if you can save just one car trip with AI use, which I've done a number of times in just the last couple of months, you have more than offset your AI use for a year. Meanwhile, a 1 gawatt data center uses as much electricity as 1 million American homes. And that 1 gawatt of power requires roughly 10 square <5>
miles of solar panels to produce. Big picture, the full $7 trillion buildout, which is estimated to use something like 80 gawatts of power over time, would represent a 1 to2% increase in global energy usage, which is less than the expected increase due to general global economic development over the same period of time. And finally, that full 80 gawatts of power, if it were all powered with solar panels, would require 800 square miles of area, less than 1% of the size of the state of Nevada. The water usage analysis is very similar, albeit a bit more complicated for reasons that you'll hear. Obviously, <6>
there is some uncertainty associated with all of these numbers. And of course, things will continue to change with forces such as increased usage and longer thinking times pushing AI resource intensity up, even while increased efficiency and new energy sources push it down. Nevertheless, I feel very good about the back of the envelope calculations and the memorable comparisons in this conversation, and I hope that it gives everyone a confident, grounded sense of how resource intensive AI really is. With that, let's get into the fundamentals of AI energy and water use with the director of EA DC, <7>
Andy Maisley. Andy Masley, director of effective altruism DC, internet truth warrior online at Andy Maasley.substack.com. Welcome to the Cognitive Revolution. &gt;&gt; Yeah, so great to be here. Longtime listener, first- time caller. Like really? Yeah, crazy privilege to be here. Thank you, David. &gt;&gt; My pleasure. Thank you. That's very kind. So, today we're going to get into AI use of energy and a little bit of other resources focusing on water probably. This has been something that for me has really kind of surprised me over the last couple months. In particular, I went and did a talk at <8>
an AI for public school educators event in October. And there's a lot of questions right on on everybody's mind across society and certainly in the education space right now like what is this going to mean? Whatever whatever but aside from the very education focused questions they were asking, I think the number one question that kept coming up over and over again is what about energy? like is it going to ruin the environment? You know, is it going to blow up our electricity bills? Like what's going to happen with this energy thing? It is clearly something that people have understood is a potentially <9>
big problem. And I think you and I are both, you know, spoiler, generally on the same page that a lot of the fears that are out there circulating are pretty overblown relative to what we actually have to worry about, which is not nothing, but you know, hopefully is something that we as a society can manage. So maybe for starters, why don't just introduce yourself a little bit? I mean, I think one one thing that is striking is, you know, I already gave the your role as the director of EADC. This is I think you you may surprise some people with your profile as I, you know, hope to do sometimes as <10>
well with a mix of opinions which aren't super easily bucketed into doomer or accelerationist. maybe give like your kind of big picture worldview and you know relationship to AI as it exists today and then we'll really dig into the resources question. &gt;&gt; Oh my but full theory of the world. Yeah, we'll take a little while to yeah I mean basic place I'm coming from is the general EA perspective that it seems very likely that machines can that can replicate a lot or even most or all of what can happen in the human mind might not be too far away. They seem more likely than not to happen in my <11>
lifetime with massive error bars there obviously and that can come with a lot of risks. So I'm pretty agnostic about P Doom stuff. I would probably lean in the direction of like a lower P doom purely because I'm a little bit wary of the very specific philosophy arguments that get made around like advanced AI like rising up and having misaligned goals and stuff like that's kind of a separate conversation. But I am very high like P weird. Like I do expect the world to get very weird in very potentially dangerous ways as like more and more powerful AI systems come online. And this is all kind of downstream <12>
of me believing that AI systems as they currently are and as they will be in the future just seem very likely to be very capable in general. And as a result of AI being capable, I'm also just like pretty excited about AI tools as they currently exist. I think this is a big disconnect that actually just makes complete sense if you think about it from this perspective of AI being capable, but I think a lot of people are also thrown off by where I'm very visibly, you know, like a massive chatbot user, you know, like Opus 4.5, basically my new best friend. It's so cool. Love it. But I'm also quite <13>
wary and worried about AI's overall impacts on society in the long term. And so I think like that combination is actually pretty common behind the scenes and a lot of people probably identify with both being excited about AI as it exists and scared in the future. But I think a lot of people have this really simplified version of the debate where you're either like a ly doomer who hates all technology including AI and wants to stop it or you're an accelerationist who wants to go full speed ahead and loves AI because they think nothing bad will ever happen. And there's just an obvious middle ground <14>
here like a pretty easy ven diagram intersection where it's like yeah I don't know like for the same reason that I think nuclear power is really good but also you know nuclear stuff comes with some tail risks too like machines that mimic a lot of what happens in the human mind like very useful for me personally very excited about a lot of what they're doing but also like man this could get really crazy really fast and there are a lot of potential risks that come with that so that's the general background attitude that I'm coming in with. Yeah, I think that is pretty representative of the EA, you <15>
know, it's obviously hard to paint a movement with such a simple descriptor, but when I've attended EA events, for example, my own personal experience has been mostly what people seem to want to talk to me about is like, hey, could you maybe help advise my organization on how we can make better use of AIS as they exist today? while at the same time maybe one of the things that they're trying to do is, you know, either raise awareness or try to figure out, you know, some of these big picture long-term tail risks, you know, wrap their heads around them better in any number of ways. But the that fear <16>
is in my experience like very often packaged, I would say, you know, much more often than not packaged with a appreciation for what the technology can do for us today. And certainly, you know, nobody is, not nobody, but you know, there's, I'd say, very few who fail to recognize that in the the EA movement as I've encountered it. &gt;&gt; Very much. Yeah. And I think behind the scenes, EA is much more heterogeneous than a lot of people might be aware of where there are wildly different takes about like the basic AI X-ray case. Definitely different scenes where you can maybe receive like some social <17>
capital or punishment for like believing different things. And I think that's bad obviously, but at least where I am in DC, which is one of the largest EA communities anywhere, like I've never personally experienced any kind of like social pressure to like believe the absolute craziest things about like AI risk. Like I feel very confident being very agnostic about that actually, which is very nice. So I'm a fan there. And yeah, I think like most EAS I know are like coming at this from a general like we're very excited about a lot of technology and like in some ways it wouldn't really make sense <18>
if everyone were like oh AI is going to be so capable in 20 years that it could kill everyone but it's not currently capable enough to be useful in answering my emails or something like that. Like that combination I think is like becoming pretty rare pretty fast. And like usually a lot of like skepticism about current AI models is also paired with skeptic skepticism about like future risks from misuse or like misalignment and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The coalitions are a little odd these the scrambling is well underway which is probably healthy I think in you know better that than just total <19>
polarization. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it does mean people sometimes incorrectly project certain beliefs onto you know their uh debate partners. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh sorry. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; No, please. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Like without calling anyone out, like every now and then I'll bump into someone being like, "Oh, you know, like this guy's an EA. He's like a communist lite who wants to destroy all technology and just like level everything because he hates freedom and stuff." And like I like this doesn't really describe the profile of like the people I'm bumping into. I think there's just like <20>
a lot of AI doom in the air right now from a bunch of different directions, including like climate doom, which we're going to get into here. And I think like in most cases like there just a lot of examples of like worry about AI that a lot of EAS just don't really share that I like I think my takes on AI in the environment is shared like not just in EA but in a lot of other with a lot of other people who are just knowledgeable about the technical aspects of this but there's a huge disconnect between there and like the broader society and a lot of circles who are much more worried. Yeah, I tend <21>
to say about that, but basically just yeah, basically a part of this has just been like presenting like, hey, look, you know, like I'm an EA, like I can like say what I believe very directly about the stuff and like I definitely don't believe a lot of the like standard environmental worry about AI as it's presented in a lot of the media right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let's get into that. How would you describe what people broadly are hearing from the media? like what is the you know baseline &gt;&gt; mainstream narrative that you are kind of setting out to correct? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean there are <22>
different levels of confidence I have about different claims here. So the media is covering the general data center buildout a lot and there like a huge amount of uncertainty and concern is I think definitely warranted because this is just this huge new industrial project. We don't really know how it's going to go or what the consequences are going to be. So I think that there the main thing I'm trying to correct is there are a lot of assumptions that this will just automatically definitely be bad for the environment or it's already causing these huge cataclysms. And I think I want to adjust people <23>
more to observing like what are the actual facts on the ground. What are the potential trade-offs here? Let's not just assume automatically that using more energy or water is always necessarily bad. Like there are a lot of places where this can potentially be good for communities that receive like a new massive taxable industry that's using like a normal amount of water and providing a lot of new revenue for utility and stuff like that. And I'm not saying this doesn't also come with pro problems. I'm just asking that the positives be weighed against the negatives on kind of a case by case basis. <24>
And I do worry that a lot of the coverage there especially is kind of framing like oh any environmental harm cannot be traded off with the positives. There's nothing good that's coming from this. And I kind of just want to push against that extreme case while still leaving a lot of uncertainty. And then the main the thing that I feel most confident about separately that I do want to demolish honestly I'm just like so tired of this talking point bouncing around. It sounds like you bumped into this as well is the idea that your personal chatbot use is significantly contributing to your emissions <25>
or your personal water footprint. Like we can have a debate about like maybe like personal footprints don't even matter and all that matters is big systematic stuff. Like I actually think that's pretty healthy as a way of thinking. But if you are worried about this stuff, I'm just I'm more convinced than I can be of most things that poking around on chat bots, even if you use them a lot throughout the day, is just not going to add a meaningful amount to your carbon or water footprint and in many cases might actually reduce it. And like we can get we can get into that more later. So I think like <26>
that I still bump into so many people with such wild misconceptions about this including people who are very influential in like big institutions and stuff who are making decisions saying like the people in my institution cannot use chat bots because the individual environmental harm of those individual prompts is too much basically and like that I think is ridiculous. We just have the numbers. It's looking pretty good. There's uncertainty but the range of uncertainty isn't enough to justify this right now. So like that's a big thing I'm pushing back against. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's crazy. I haven't <27>
heard of any like organization leaders giving dictates along those lines. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sworn to secrecy on who basically unfortunately like basically I recently interacted with like a large educational institution where like the people in charge of the technology there were just completely convinced that like this isn't actually so bad and like we should really like be able to pay for this for like our lowincome students especially to like have access to chat bots and stuff. But we're mainly we're getting a lot of push back from a lot of different places basically being like this will be <28>
like bad for the environment if we do this to the point that we can't do this and like using that logic like it also wouldn't make sense to ever purchase books for any students and stuff like that. There's just a lot of stuff to say about that. But this is happening and I think it's like a lot of people who are focused on AI like on the ground are pretty shielded from this because like I think they're much more aware of what the actual numbers look like and I think there's people might be blind to just how common this is and like how many people have not touched chat bots at all specifically because <29>
they're completely convinced that this is a significant ad to their personal emissions. And you know a lot more to say about that like some people are not touching them because they're worried about contributing to a systematic thing. can say more about that. But like the general misconception here I think is just so widespread still and it's like a massive tragedy. I think like in blogging about this it kind of feels like shooting fish in a barrel. Like it's just like a little bit goofy when you actually look at the numbers. But yeah, I tend to get into there. But that's the other main thing that <30>
I'm trying to address. &gt;&gt; Yeah. One strategy for rising to prominence in an online building your online voice is pick an area where people are dramatically and consistently wrong and then you can be very consistently right. Yeah. Um, okay. So, so where do you think like what is the sort of what is the move that's happening that's like distributing this bad information, you know, incorrect understandings in the first place? I mean, one thing I've observed in general is just that like the world is really huge and so when you aggregate numbers associated with almost anything, you get to these <31>
like really big numbers. So I think one pattern that maybe is happening is people are sort of saying here's how much energy AI is going to use. It's you know yada whatever kind of watts and isn't that insane and people are like that is insane and then there's just no reference to anything else and so it's like this sort of very big number hangs out in a vacuum and intimidates people because they don't see the other you know even much bigger numbers that maybe they should be comparing it to. How much of it is that? What do you think is kind of going on that is creating this sort of broad misconception <32>
in the first place? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's coming from a lot of different directions. I think for there was a lot of coverage of this early on. There was a lot of individual news coverage about the cost of individual prompts. And there's an outdated talking point about how it's 10 times as much as a Google search. And I think for a lot of people, this was the first time they had ever seriously thought about their internet activity using resources in general. And I think there's actually something that just feels really wrong to people about that because digital goods are ephemeral and they're just <33>
this like 2D thing on your screen. And especially if you don't like AI or if you think AI is all silly or whatever, like it's this ridiculous like meaningless use of these valuable resources, especially water. Actually, I think the idea of AI burning through water really sticks with people because they kind of imagine it as this like dwindling resource that we might eventually run out of and we need to conserve it and protect ourselves from that. And there's this like, you know, ridiculous new thing that they don't like burning through a huge amount of it for silly reasons. Like I think there's <34>
almost like a religious sense of sin about that like really gets to people at some deep level just because they might not have thought about how oh data centers have used water for a while for other things. And like you know people also watch Netflix shows that I don't think are very good and that uses water and maybe like I would be more upset about that if I thought it was a serious problem but like even there like not too much water is being used. I think there's just been a lot of really weird and bad media coverage of this that's definitely caught on in social media a lot too. Like there are <35>
a lot of just like Tik Toks and tweets like kind of giving I think very silly explanations of how like you know very grimly talking about how a chatbot is 10 times as much as a Google search. you're multiplying your emissions by 10 times. And they never stop to mention like, oh, by the way, 10 times a Google search is still not that much. You know, like if I prompted Google like a thousand times, if I search Google like a thousand times throughout the day, that's actually still not going to add too much to my emissions. And so I shouldn't expect that a 100 chat GPT prompts will either. And so there's <36>
a lot of hyperfocus on these relative numbers because almost no one including like me too much before I actually started look looking into this like actually knows where a lot of the energy they use like is or like how much it is and stuff. So a lot of different stuff there's like general anti-AI attitudes which you know otherwise understand worrying about. There's like a sense that this is like all these valuable resources. One very last one is this very strong sense that people have that because we're in a climate crisis it is never acceptable to add a new source of emissions. This is very common. <37>
I bump into this all the time where like even if AI is adding so little, it's like new emissions that didn't exist before. And this is actually a really strange category when you think about it because like every day we all wake up and cause new emissions in everything we do. You know, like every time I drive my car, I'm adding new emissions to the atmosphere that will stick around for like a thousand years or something. And the source doesn't really matter in my opinion. Like it definitely matters to an extent, but I think a lot of people are really hung up on the idea that this is like a new <38>
thing or a new way of emitting. and like thinking less about other stuff. And then like the very last thing I'll say is that like the data center buildout is objectively huge and I think people have a lot of trouble computing how such a huge new use of energy can relate to such small amounts on a personal level. And I think a lot of this is just that data centers are these really weird paradoxical buildings that aggregate huge amounts of very tiny emissions in one place. So like they all look really huge together, but this would all appear like if we were able to aggregate anything else we do in <39>
society as well. like if all toasters or all microwaves were in one spot, like that would also look very large by the standards of an individual person. So, a lot to say, a lot of stuff that's floating around in the background here, but all of this is kind of congealed in to this very broad sentiment that using chat GPT is bad for the environment. And in my opinion, it is not. &gt;&gt; Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors. &gt;&gt; Are you still jumping between multiple tools just to update your website?

Each episode features a candid conversation with a seuite leader from companies including Intercom, Replet, Superhum, Air Table, and Box who's leading AI across their organization turning early experiments into lasting change. We recently cross-osted an episode that Wade did with One Mind founder and CEO Amanda Kao about AIEL sales and I also particularly enjoyed his conversation with <43>
John Nurona, chief product officer of AI product pioneer and recently minted double unicorn gamma. From mindset shifts to automation breakthroughs, Agents of Scale tells the stories behind the enterprise AI wave. Subscribe to Agents of Scale wherever you get your podcasts. Yeah, I one of my general principles is don't psychize others AI takes because I think the whole you know the facts are confusing enough and the you know the fog of AI forecasting is pretty thick in many cases. So I really do try to avoid that. I guess I'll, you know, maybe break that rule very slightly, very briefly by asking <44>
like do you think this is primarily coming from the environmental movement and is just bad tactics or misunderstanding or another corner and maybe it can be both, but another corner it could be coming from is sort of an anti- AI motivation that is like trying to find things that are resonant with the public. even if you know that's even if those arguments that work aren't necessarily at the sort of core of the motivation like what would you say you've encountered in your online battles? [laughter] Yeah, I actually mostly don't think this is coming from the actual environmental movement like on <45>
the ground environmentalists. Like maybe a few of them like get mad about this in the way that other people do, but it's not really originating there at all. I think it's mostly coming from a much broader swath of people who I would say are like fired up and sometimes a little bit confused about climate where they engage with a lot of like doomy like climate social media and like I just want to flag throughout all this that I am very worried about climate change. I don't want to say that this is not a problem or whatever but there's this like separate category of person who isn't actually involved <46>
in actual environmental work but just engages with a lot of like very guiltridden media about very specific things that they do in their personal lives. I think the environmental movement for the most part has like correctly moved on from policing personal lifestyle stuff so much into like focusing on systematic changes to the energy grid. Like huge win there. That's great. But the public discourse hasn't really followed along. And so a lot of people like I don't know I I used to be a physics teacher for seven years which is also like important context here. And I just like remember a lot of my <47>
students actually really believe really strange things about climate mostly because of like TikTok where they'd be like oh we're all going to die by like 2024 or something you know because of climate change or society's going to fall apart. And I think this is mostly coming from people who have this like cluster of beliefs about climate who have kind of memed themselves into this idea that like any tiny amount of new emissions is always a catastrophe and oh this silly thing AI is using new emissions and so that's bad basically. So yeah that's my basic guess about like the main culprit here. There's <48>
like a general broader social media sense of climate doom that sometimes causes people to not think so much about the actual numbers involved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Great. Well, let's get into some of the actual numbers involved. How do you want to attack it? I mean, I think we can come at it from multiple angles. There's the sort of, you know, unit of one chat GBT request and you know what that uses. There's also, you know, all sorts of comparisons we could use like to a microwave or to a you know, heating one's home or driving one's car. There's also kind of top- down economic stuff which I think <49>
is often like way too quickly brushed past as well. Like chatbt is 20 bucks a month. You know, that sort of puts a pretty clear limit on like how much energy it could really be using. Of course, they could be subsidizing it, but they are subsidizing the free users presumably in part, you know, with the revenue from the paid users. What do you find to be the most probably at least dabble in all three of those and maybe even more different ways of thinking about it, but what do you find to be the most intuitive or resonant way to start to break this down for people? For a while, I was mostly making <50>
those kinds of individual comparisons and I was finding that in a lot of places they didn't hit and I was trying to figure out why. Whereas, like, oh, you know, it's this much to charge your phone. It's, you know, a microwave can add up to being like hundreds or even like if you use it for long enough, like yeah, I'll limit it to hundreds for now. attal. And I realized that they weren't getting this other big intuition I had. So my elevator pitch like if I meet someone at a party now my general pitch is that to the best of my knowledge based on all the resources that we have on this once you add <51>
up all the ways that a chatbot can cause emissions like not just including the inference like the cooling the training the embodied cost of the hardware my best guess like right now is that lands you at about.3 g of carbon emitted per prompt on average and I'm making a lot of assumptions assuming that's actually kind of high and that's about 1 100,000th of your daily emissions. And so what that means is that you would have to prompt chat GPT something like a thousand times to increase your emissions by 1%. And if you did that, if you were spending the entire day doing nothing but prompting ChatGpt <52>
and reading all the responses, that would probably take you something like 10 hours or something at least. And if you think about it, like spending 10 hours a day on something that only uses 1% of your emissions actually implies that your emissions will be way lower than they would otherwise be, if that makes sense. Because most other things that we do in our lives, like we're not just going to be sitting not doing anything all day. Like we would be like taking a walk or like driving our car or something like that or even like watching a show on TV. And so if chatbt is this small, it actually probably <53>
means that anything you replace it with will emit more except for other things online. Like computing is just so wildly efficient that like almost nothing else we do uses as little energy basically. And so like my elevator pitch is basically like it's chatbt actually uses so little energy that on net it actually seems much more likely to reduce your emissions because in general like probably the single most like climate optimized way you can live your life is living in a big city being vegan and spending literally all your day on your computer. And like I check two of three of those boxes. Like <54>
I try to get out, you know, [laughter] but like you know and like I don't spend all day on my computer, but like computing is just so efficient compared to most other things that we do that it's just not a good thing to trade off if that's what you're worried about for the climate basically. So that's my basic pitch and like can go into a lot of the other comparisons. Like I like making the comparisons to microwaves and stuff like that, but like basic ground level thing is that this is going to reduce your emissions if you trade it off against anything that's not on the computer specifically. And <55>
it's just so small that it would kind of be sad if we were focused on this in any other context. It's taking like a little dropper from your pot of spaghetti and like, oh, I need to save a few drops for later, you know, like something like that. I think we would call correctly a distraction for someone so focused on climate and environment stuff. So that's my basic pitch in a nutshell. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the bits versus atoms distinction is a pretty strong place to start. It is I often think about the the energy that it takes to charge a phone. I was really, this is something actually GPT4 <56>
a little bit of lore is that the original GPT4 while I was doing the red teaming, this is now like, you know, basically three years ago, a little more than three years ago at this point, it, you know, really took me through some of these energy analyses very early on. And it was one of the kind of Eureka moments where I was like, man, this thing can really help me educate myself in all these different areas. But I was shocked to learn that a typical cell phone to charge it fully is something like 20 watt hours of energy, which in my jurisdiction in Detroit, Michigan is about a third of a cent worth <57>
of electricity. And we've now also heard a lot recently that the brain itself runs on 20 watts. So the energy that your phone works on for say a you know whatever depending on how intensively you use it a 12 or 24 hour cycle that's the same energy that your own brain is using in just 1 hour. So already you know all the things that your phone is doing and you know obviously we've seen language models that can run on phones and we've you know not the frontier ones of course but you know you can run Java models you can run things on your phone you can run things on your laptop those are literally <58>
running on less energy than your own brain which is a you know an interesting start comparison. Yeah. And it really just kind of goes up from there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And like this is actually a reason why I've mostly moved away from comparisons to individual objects because I've realized that most people, including me before I started, like don't actually have much of a solid idea of how much energy individual objects use. Like I've actually come to think that most people seem to have a scale in their head where something either uses a little amount of energy, a normal amount, or a lot. And <59>
it's one of those three basically. And so they might think like oh chatbt uses like this isn't actually true but like let's say chatbt uses as much energy as it takes to charge your phone. They might think like oh that's a normal amount. So chat GBT is adding this new significant thing to my carbon emissions and they're not thinking about just how big the scale is. Like you know without getting into Twitter stats too much I just had a guy respond to me the other day and being like oh chat GPT uses as much as charging your phone or running a microwave for an hour. And I wanted to hit the brakes <60>
and be like, well, those are two very different quantities, you know, like almost nobody seems to notice just how little energy it takes to charge your phone specifically. And this is like a comparison that gets made a lot. And so like I can make these other comparisons where it's like, yeah, it's something like 60 chatbot prompts per like phone charge or something like that or per like minute of microwave or something like a chatbot prompt is effectively like a second of a microwave. I will flag actually here that like whenever I say a prompt, I'm talking about like the median chatbot prompt. <61>
And like this is a whole separate thing we can get into with like much longer prompts and stuff like that, but like we need a place to start. And so yeah, these comparisons to household stuff can sometimes be less helpful than I expected because a lot of people still, including me a lot of the time, don't have much of an idea about this. But yeah, something like 60 prompts per phone charge or like about a prompt per second of using a microwave or something like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's helpful. Well, maybe let's dwell on it a little bit more and hope maybe we can kind of help popularize a few <62>
of these memes. So, I guess you know orders of magnitude are always kind of helpful, right? Like the human body runs on basically 100 watts, 20 watts of that is the brain. So, now we can just look at a few household appliances. The microwave typically runs at about a thousand watts. An electric teapot and the themes here obviously are like heating things is energy intensive, right? So, the microwave is heating. The electric teapot is also about 1,000 watts. Those are heating things. Running my furnace here in the winter time. You know, though a lot of energy is going through that and obviously <63>
depends on how cold it is outside and all that kind of stuff. It roughly shakes out to at least for electricity from what I understand. The average US home is doing about a thousand watts of electricity on an averaged out basis. And obviously, you know, when you turn on your microwave and whatever that spikes up relative to your base load, but like rough intuition is a home is running on a 1000 watts, a body is running on 100 watts, a brain is running on 20 watts, and chat GPT then comes in with you said one one prompt roughly equal to one second of a micro. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Yep. Yep. Just like <64>
that. Yeah. And like you know, inner physics teachers coming out. So just want to flag for the listeners. Yeah. A watt is a rate of using energy and then a watt hour is a unit of energy because it's that rate multiplied by a certain amount of time basically. So yeah, a thousand watts if you run that amount of power for an hour, you use up a thousand watt hours specifically. And so yeah, a chat GPT prompt from best I can tell is between like.3 and 6 W hours for the median prompt. And that is going to yeah it's effectively like running a one watt thing for about like three to point six hours. And <65>
like a one watt thing is also like an alarm clock or something. So like if your clock is just running a digital clock specifically. So if your digital clock is running normally.3 watt hours is about the same as like.3 hours of running a digital clock specifically. Yeah, that's really And I guess it's also worth noting the a kilowatt hour is the typical unit of electrical billing. So when I said it's, you know, 20 cents in my power jurisdiction, that 20 cents is for a kilowatt hour. Which also then leads to another kind of interesting comparison that if my $20 CET GPT subscription went entirely <66>
to energy, it would buy 100 kilowatt hours, which would be basically 4 days of a typical home electrical usage. And that would assume again that they're taking obviously we know that we can get into this in more detail too, but obviously we know they're not turning around and spending all of my $20 on electricity cuz for one thing, you know, they've got chips to buy and they've got, you know, researchers to train and all sorts of other costs. But that kind of gives you a absolute max if you were to just spend $20 more on electricity. You know, that's kind of roughly increasing your typical home <67>
electrical bill by 10%. And so again, it's like way less than that. So we kind of seem to be coming down to these like 1%ish numbers. It's probably still significantly less than that today. You had said like you got to get to a thousand prompts a day to increase your overall footprint by 1%. And I do think that's where, you know, certainly the people at the model development companies think we're going and that's why they're, you know, planning such big buildouts, but it is hard to imagine usage that moves one's overall energy footprint all that much more than that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I will flag <68>
too that when people talk about energy, obviously there's some concern about electric bills around data centers, but mostly when people talk about this, they're actually using it as a proxy for carbon emissions, right? because like we're worried about climate and something else that I think doesn't get through to people a lot is that something like I don't have the exact number but it's something like 25% to a third of our carbon emissions come from the electricity that we use and 2/3s come from other sources like direct use of fossil fuels like driving your car as an example and so like even within <69>
that electricity so assuming that like all of your money all of the $20 is going to chat GBT and it becomes like four four days of your like household bill and 10% of your electricity use because your electricity use is only about 25% of your actual emissions like that actually drops even more to something like maybe you know like 3% of your actual emissions. So like the absolute most ridiculous situation where like OpenAI is taking your money spending all of it on electricity all the time which it's actually just much smaller than that. Like even there the absolute most this could possibly be <70>
raising your emissions is something like 3%. And that would actually be significant. You know, like something that raises your emissions by 3% is like definitely not nothing. But my claim is also that it's much smaller than that. And that's like the absolute most it can be economically. Unless of course like Chhat GPT is just giving everyone huge amounts of free energy, which just doesn't seem likely. You know, like AI companies just don't want to do that if they can avoid it. &gt;&gt; Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors. The worst thing about automation <71>
is how often it breaks. You build a structured workflow, carefully map every field from step to step, and it works in testing.

Well, there's maybe a good way. I don't know if this is the next place we should go immediately, but another good angle <76>
of attack on that question is what does it cost to buy chips and then what does it cost to run chips? Do you think we should dig into that now? Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, I was looking into this a little bit and it's actually pretty counterintuitive where the cost of a chip versus the cost of running it in money actually doesn't seem to tell you very much about like the carbon costs involved because most of the actual cost of the chip seems to be like the Nvidia premium and like the cost of like these incredibly complex supply chains all working so well together and like the market <77>
you know basically you know Nvidia running a lot of this stuff basically and so there's this huge premium that you're paying and so as an example So, an 8 an 8GPU H100 server node costs about $300,000. And over a 4-year lifespan, the server will consume about like $35,000 in electricity, which is only about 10% of its purchase price. So, like this chip as an example, 90% of the cost is in purchasing it and only 10% is in actually running it. And so, you might think that like if that's the case, maybe most of the carbon cost is also in actually producing it. But that price is actually just mostly <78>
reflecting other stuff. One way that one intuition I have that's pretty useful for this and I'll talk about more of the proportions in a second. But like ultimately when you think about it like an AI chip is just designed to have electricity flowing through it as much as possible like over its entire lifespan you know and it's if I designed a wire and it just started to flow electricity through the wire until the wire burned out and I was like okay what took more carbon like making the wire itself or like making all that electricity to flow through the wire to the point that it eventually blows <79>
out. And like I I don't know, it's kind of similar to like I've never once thought about the carbon emissions of like the wires in my home, but I have thought about the carbon emissions of my electricity bills a lot. And so in the same way I because so much electricity flows through AI chips, we should basically expect most of their carbon cost to actually be in the electricity itself rather than in the embedded cost of making the chip in the first place. And Nvidia conveniently actually shares the carbon cost of all its chips. Now, it seems like one positive aspect of people focusing more on the <80>
environmental stuff on this is that a lot of companies are just doing this more. And based on what I can tell, it seems like the ratio is something like 20 to1 of the carbon of the electricity versus the actual embodied cost of making these chips itself. So, it's actually like wildly disproportionate where it's something like like at least 10 to one in the other direction of the cost of like purchase purchasing the chips and money versus like the cost of the electricity. But the carbon cost is completely flipped where most of the carbon cost is in the electricity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, another way <81>
to think about that or kind of validate that would be if it cost $300,000 to buy this pod of eight chips and then $35,000 to run it over a lifespan of four years, then we all know right off the bat that Nvidia's margins are something like 80%. So that takes down their, you know, cost of marginal production to something like $60,000. And that still includes, you know, the relationship with TSMC and, you know, shipping the things all around the world and all that sort of stuff. And so you kind of have a at least a governor there on the top of like, well, it can't be more than that because they've, <82>
you know, we know what their margins are. And then you're also, you know, highlighting that they're just straight up publishing an analysis of what their energy is and saying it's like Did you say 1% of total or &gt;&gt; Oh, it's 10%. It seems like that or like about the energy cost of running energy in like dollars is about 10% of the cost of actually purchasing the chip in the first place with money. And then the carbon cost is flipped where it's something like 20 to one. The carbon of the emissions of actually using the electricity is like 20 times as much as that. And it could get even higher <83>
because like a lot of AI data centers are built with grids with obviously like reliable cheap energy. And unfortunately right now in the reality we live in that tends toward more fossil fuels being used. And so as a result like their electricity might actually be even dirtier than the grid average. And so like that's another thing where that's actually raising the carbon cost even more. So out of a $300,000 pot of eight, you can then expect a call it you know 10 to1 call it a $30,000 energy bill over the lifetime of the chip. And then if you flip back to, well, what was the energy cost of that <84>
on the production side? It's another 20 to1 reduction, aka something like $1,500 spent on energy or in other words, like half a percent basically of the original cost of the chip. It's always interesting to kind of flip these things back and forth between money and emissions. But yeah, because the markets are so like weird here, it just like doesn't track very closely. like money just tells you like very little about like how much was emitted at different points. And I think that in general, this is a really funny area where sometimes when I talk about the carbon cost of a median prompt, people <85>
will be like, "Oh, but you're not including these hidden costs." You know, like these things like the embodied cost of the hardware itself. And like they'll never actually try to make a guess at what that actually is. And like when you poke at the embodied cost of chips, that anyway seems pretty marginal. You know, it's like 10% 5% sometimes. So that doesn't really concern me super much. It doesn't add too much to the cost. Like the real like secret cost that I do think actually significantly raises it is the cost of training the models, but that's like a software question rather than a hardware <86>
question obviously. So that's like something else we can talk about. But there like my best guess right now is that maybe it like doubles the full energy or emissions cost. So it goes from like.3 to6 watt hours or something like that. Has pretty wide error bars. But yeah, I can go into that separately. But at least for like at least for the hardware, I think it makes about as much sense to worry a lot about the embodied carbon cost of AI chips as it does to worry about the embodied carbon cost of like the wires in your home that electricity flows through. You know, like these things are just so <87>
hyperoptimized. And there's also just like something a common theme about this is that like so many people are being paid to think in really complicated ways of optimizing the energy use of these chips as much as possible. You know, there's just like a huge amount of incentive to do that. And so like we should expect that like yeah there's a lot of electricity flowing through them but also that they're like relatively optimized just a lot of stuff to say basically but yeah I expect that most of the cost in general of a chip to be in like running the energy through it rather than in the energy used <88>
to make it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. I think that's quite helpful. Do you want to do I know you said these don't always hit but I want to &gt;&gt; Oh I mean I love sending them. You want to do one to like driving a car or taking a flight? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, like this is actually, let's see, best I can tell is that if you're driving a car for 20 miles or so, that's going to probably emit 3 to 4 kg of CO2 if it's a sedan. And that's something like 10,000 chatbot prompts or so. And so, like I sometimes think about it like if I didn't want to feel guilty about chatbot prompts, like if I was worried <89>
about that, you know, if I avoid a single car trip, I get 10,000 free chatbot prompts to use however I want. This is also like an interesting argument for ways that chat bots might be able to onnet reduce someone's emissions in other ways. Like I think in these conversations in general, something else I try to flag is that almost all of the climate impacts of AI and environmental impacts in general are almost definitely going to come from how AI is used rather than the actual energy used in data centers. Like for the same reason that all other computing works the same way. Like if we're trying <90>
to think about Amazon's impact on the environment, you know, there's like shipping and like other things that it affects, but like looking at the energy cost of running the Amazon website in data centers isn't going to tell us very much about its total impacts. And so like if AI is actually changing your behavior at all, like that's just where most of the impact is going to be. And so if one of those 10,000 chatbot prompts that equals a 20 m car ride like prevents you from taking that trip, like you realize, oh, I looked into this and I don't actually need to drive out to do this thing or I can <91>
get it somewhere else. like that's at least going to modify your behavior enough that like that's going to significantly change your emissions. Like potentially not for the better either. Like maybe it's the case that it will cause you to do something else that is maybe silly. But the comparisons here get kind of comical. Flights can get up to like the millions at times. So like a single intercontinental flight or sorry transcontinental flight can I think go over like at least 1 million and potentially 2 million chatbot prompts which is more than I'll probably do in my lifetime. like I consider <92>
myself to be a chatbot power user, but I'm probably not going to hit that, you know, and so like if I decide, you know, if I make a very extreme decision like, oh, I won't take that, you know, European vacation this year, but at least now I can use chatbots basically forever without any guilt. water comparisons actually get even more ridiculous because like I think the average person just doesn't actually know where most of their own water footprint is because the main way we experience water in our lives is like in the water we drink, maybe a shower, watering our lawns if we have one. And most <93>
of the actual ways that our lifestyles consume water is way far away from our homes. It's like in the food that we eat. It's in like the power that generates our home or that is used to power our home and stuff like that. And there's some like I'm pretty sure the average water cost of a prompt if you include everything including the upside cost rises to something like 1800,000th of your daily water consumption when you include everything else. And so there the numbers get really silly. Like I'm pretty sure that if someone avoids buying a single additional pair of jeans like that is worth a million <94>
chatbot crops worth of water or something just because like jeans might require like irrigated cotton to grow or something like that. And so, and this kind of is like this makes intuitive sense to me because if I think about how water is being used in the genes case, like huge amounts of water are flowing to like grow plants and like they become part of the plant itself. Whereas with AI, it's flowing in the vicinity of hot computers basically and like it's capturing some of the heat that my individual prompt generated. And I'm like, well, how would I expect the proportions here to look? Ultimately, <95>
it makes sense that there can be these huge order of magnitude differences between those things. So yeah, a lot more comparisons I can make, but at least with like energy, yeah, like a single second of your microwave is probably about a chat GPT prompt or even like three or so. It just gets pretty comical pretty fast. And so like if you're willing to like use your microwave for a few additional seconds, you should be okay with a few additional chatbot prompts, too. And this is actually a good comparison for longer prompts because some people will be like, "Oh, what Andy's saying is about median <96>
prompts, but obviously there are all these other things. these long like coding tasks and reasoning tasks and stuff like that. And it's true that those use a lot more energy, but it seems kind of like just running your microwave for longer. And like if I had a friend with a microwave that if you used it for a minute could produce like a very thorough research overview of a field, you know, or it's like, "Ooh, I heated up a new like, you know, some a ton of new useful code for whatever I'm working on." Like I wouldn't actually be super bothered if they were using the microwave for that, you know? <97>
Like I use it to heat like vegan chicken nuggets and I don't feel bad about that. And like in comparison like when these larger models start to get talked about and it's like oh like you're either using the prompt is much longer or the reasoning time is much longer like that definitely adds to the cost. But I think like anyone who's used like a deep research prompt or a coding prompt also knows how valuable the outputs are compared to like even a normal prompt. And so like basically the microwave comparison is really useful here because it can basically be like oh this thing is like a microwave <98>
and like however long it takes is kind of like running a microwave that long with error bars obviously but like at the end if like I had a microwave in my home that produced a deep research level response to something like I would be using that quite a bit and not feel super bad about the results personally. So yeah I'll have to say about that but like the comparisons can be useful here in a lot of ways once you like get the context down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's let me just kind of rederive maybe har one again just for my own and everybody's benefit to get the reps on kind of stepping through it. <99>
So let's say I have a 20 gallon tank in my car. That's one way I like to think about it. The unit of the fillup, right? So I've got gasoline weighs about 5 lb a gallon. Water is 8 lb a gallon. Gasoline is lighter. So roughly you fill up your car with a 20 gallon tank. you have put 100 lb of fuel into the tank. Now that actually becomes a lot somewhat surprisingly or weirdly becomes a lot more massive as it gets converted to exhaust because your hydrocarbon is basically just a chain of carbons with hydrogen atoms alongside it. And each carbon atom becomes a CO2 in in full combustion. You can have <100>
CO I guess in there as well, but obviously we're going to simplify away a lot of details. So we'll call it CO2. Oxygen weighs more than carbon. So you've more than, roughly speaking, you've tripled the mass. For every carbon atom that gets combusted, you have a CO2, triple the mass. So I've gone from 100 pound of fuel into the car to 300 lb of emissions, which if I convert that to kilog, we'll call it 150. And then that becomes 150,000 g. 150,000 g compared to one chatbot prompt was a third of a gram. So my full tank of gas gets into the range of roughly half a million chatbot median chatbot prompts. <101>
And then you had scaled that down by let's say I took just one 20 mile trip. That would be like one of my 20 gallons. So if I divided that by 20 from half a million I get down to 20 25,000 like 10,000. So kind of came at it from a different angle but we ended up within like 50% of each other. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I should double check the numbers there obviously because it gets a little hand wavy at the extremes here but yeah yeah exactly. I think like that I this brings back when I was first learning about climate change actually. I remember hearing the fact that like, oh, if you see a huge pile <102>
of coal and that's all emitted, the CO2 weighs so much more than the pile because oxygen is being added to it. And I remember just having this deep sense of like evil. Like coal is just such like the ultimate bad guy in like climate conversations that it's just like a really funny fact that like the stuff that you use will end up actually adding way more to the atmosphere than it itself weighs. It's pretty crazy. But yeah, that's a really good intuition. Yeah, like a full tank of gas can use like at least like hundreds of thousands of chatbot prompts and like we do that pretty regularly. This leads <103>
into another interesting general comment on like climate stuff where the main way that we emit and like the main way that like most of our emissions happen is actually with stuff that is otherwise very useful to us. Like I think people sometimes have this idea that like oh well I should focus on chat bots a lot because I think chat bots are useless and it's a useless form of emissions. And I think that like something like 99% of the actual emissions reductions that we need to make are actually going to be in like the useful category. And like highlighting these like tiny little useless quote unquote <104>
emissions like it makes sense to worry about those. Like obviously we want to emit less if we can and if something's useless we want to cut it. But in terms of the amount of attention it should actually take up. Like the big challenge of climate change that's actually preventing us from making change is how much emissions are actually very useful. Like driving a car is very useful to me. And so like another part of this debate that I find comes up a lot is that no matter how small I can express the chatbot as how much how small the emissions are like people will be like oh yeah but it's useless <105>
and it's just this silly plagiarism machine. So it's we should somehow focus on it more than all these useful emissions and like I kind of want to get it through to them that like the useful emissions are actually so large and so much more difficult to change. That's what needs the most of our attention. And so a lot to say about that but like the car example just brings up a lot of different associations there. So, just to repeat it one more time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; One cross town 20-m trip is worth order of magnitude 10,000 chatbot prompts. One tank of gas, 20 times more than <106>
that, is worth something like a quarter to a half a million chatbot prompts. And then if we go up to a cross-country flight, we take basically another couple orders of magnitude up and we get to basically like a million, which again makes sense if you think figure, you know, just the cost of the flight and how much of that goes to energy from what I've seen like a non-trivial unlike the AI companies like the airlines are actually indeed turning around and spending a pretty significant share of your money on the jet fuel. And so, you know, you might be spending north of $100 per passenger on jet <107>
fuel to get country. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like what it actually brings up like a funny intuition where like driving solo actually seems to emit about as much as like a long plane flight as a passenger specifically, which I think people have some weird intuitions about where they think like the plane might be a thousand times worse, but driving actually is just surprisingly bad. And the main way that like flying adds to our emissions is that it just causes us to travel longer distance rather than like per mile being worse. And so like it makes sense that like the plane scaling up is going to be about <108>
the same as like an equivalent amount of like distance traveled in the car. And yeah, this all just adds up to like comical amounts of like chatbot prompts. It's just like, you know, even if you thought this was evil, but you saw any value in chat bots at all, you could just like skip a single car trip and be good for like at least a year of prompting or something like that, you know? And so like I try to get across that like all these cuts just seem very depressing to focus on in the first place. Like back when I was talking a lot more about climate change when I was in college, there was just <109>
like a really great general consensus that the name of the game is systematic change and like changing the energy grid. And like there you can have hundreds of thousands of times as much individual impact as anything you can do in your personal life. even more extreme things like you know I'm like vegan and you know I live in a city and stuff like that and that's good but like that's just not nearly as impactful as just like being one small part of a group of people who open a new solar plant or a battery facility or keeping a nuclear power plant open or something like that. And so like within <110>
personal lifestyle stuff, just like if you're gonna litigate anything, like litigate like a few big things specifically just like by the time you get to chatbot prompts, it's like as if you're like pausing YouTube a few seconds early for the sake of the climate or something. It just it like honestly a part of this debate is like quite depressing to me because I feel like the general climate conversation has receded or gotten worse since I was talking about it where like there's so much hyperfocus on these tiny things that just aren't going to matter compared to like big systematic stuff we need <111>
to do. Yeah, that's that's weird. I really [laughter] know I don't really know what to say about that. &gt;&gt; It's upsetting. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but I guess that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay, so 10,000 prompts per 20 mile car trip. A million prompts for a cross-country flight. &gt;&gt; One prompt is one second of microwave. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Hopefully these start to put people's minds a little bit more at ease. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Actually, one other comparison that I realized we hadn't made yet is that like I just want to make it completely clear that there's a really common talking point <112>
that I just want to never be mentioned again because it's just so wrong and so off, which is the like a chatbot prompt uses a bottle of water. Basically, like if you look into where this came from, it was this really misleading article from the Washington Post that basically like took this really wild estimate of how many chatbot prompts it would require to write a 100word email. It seems to assume like 10 to 20 prompts to write the single email. And like, you know, I'm a power user of chat bots, but I don't use that many. And like even there, it assumes all these other wild things like chips hadn't <113>
gained any efficiency in like 5 years since before they were commercialized. like specific things about training and evaporating water from like hydroelectric plants. Like all these things that together just tell this really I think misleading story. And the actual amount is something like 1/200th of that. It's something like 2 milll of water. And like this just seems pretty conclusive based on a bunch of different estimates and different studies from people. And so like yeah, the general comparison to water specifically, I always just want to flag that like maybe the single most popular wrong <114>
piece of information about these chat bots is that they consume a bottle of water for prompt. this is like not the case. You'd have to prompt them about 200 times to use a bottle of water. And also, you use like thousands of bottles of water or maybe not thousands, but at least hundreds of bottles of water every day in your consumptive use that you don't see because most of that is offsite in the electricity you generate and in the food that you eat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I didn't pre-run the numbers on a hot shower, but I suspect there's an awful lot of prompts in a hot shower as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. <115>
And like I I could say all kinds of crazy things about hot showers actually where like a lot of the water that goes into the hot shower is the water used to generate the electricity to heat the water. Basically, it's just like the way we use water is just like very like interesting and sometimes comical because like so much of the water we use is actually used to generate electricity where like even your alarm clock like has a big off-site water cost. Like my best estimate is that like the average digital clock uses something like 3 L of water offsite at a power plant per month. And so like even <116>
there that might be invisible to you and you might not know that this thing is burning through 3 L at a time. So yeah, a lot of stuff to say about that. But like a part of the reason why I've been writing about this so much recently is that it's honestly just pretty cool. There are a lot of like a lot of counterintuitive ways that we use energy and water and stuff like that. And I think like the chatbot conversation can honestly be really fun once you contextualize it in like the counterintuitive ways that like society uses water and didn't even touch on like all the like kind of goofy excesses <117>
in like animal agriculture and stuff like that. Like that's its own separate topic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I I think agriculture would definitely be worth doing a couple little um comparison exercises with too. But maybe before we do that, can how should we think about the relationship between energy and water and like what does it mean to use water? I think there's conflation going on in many cases where people in some cases think like this water is used like it's like destroyed or it's like contaminated and obviously contaminating water is a big problem. My sense is that's not really what is going <118>
on when that's not what people are referring to when they refer to water use, right? This is more like evaporative cooling kind of processes where the water is not like removed from the water cycle entirely. It's just sort of put into the air from you know wherever it was before that. But you know help me uh yeah sharpen that up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Three different categories of using water that is useful to think about. So first of all there's I think the most important category to know about is consumptive use of water which is water that withdraws from a very local source and either evaporates it <119>
or does something else to it that causes it to leave that very specific source of water and that can be disruptive for like high water stress areas because the water might not be returned at the same rate and over time things can dry up. So consumptive use is kind of like the main harmful way that water can be used basically. There's also water pollution where water is returned polluted in some ways. AI itself data centers can contribute to this a little bit because they can use specific chemicals in the water to keep it like very clean, but they might return some of it to a local system polluted <120>
with these chemicals. This doesn't seem to be nearly as big of a problem as like the pollution that might come from agriculture, but it's definitely not nothing. Like that's something to worry about a little bit. And then the other thing to focus on is non-conumptive withdrawal of water which is where you take water use it and then basically give it back to the source. And a lot of the ways that we generate electricity as an example mostly use like non-conumptive like water withdrawal where takes water maybe returns it a little bit warmer than it was before. That can sometimes create some problems <121>
but for the most part it's just taken and put back. And so this can lead to some really wild confusing statements about how AI uses water. Like one very popular statement about AI water use is that by 2027 it's projected to use 50% as much water as the entire United Kingdom. And like if you actually look at what that means and like what that 50% is something like 90% of that is the water that power plants withdraw and then immediately put back after. And I think that paints a very different picture. And then another something like 5% or 7% of that water is the water consumed in the power plant <122>
and not in the data center itself. And only about 3% of that amount is going to be like in data centers themselves specifically. And so like when people hear that I think they imagine like half of the UK's water flowing through data centers. And what's actually happening is that that's only going to be like you know at most maybe like 5% of the UK's water which is definitely significant. It's not nothing, but it just shows how easy it is to really wildly and sometimes unintentionally mislead people about it because like the way we use water is so counterintuitive. One other thing to note is that <123>
there's an important difference between fresh water and portable water, which is water that's been improved enough to basically be like drinking quality. Data centers themselves rely a lot on portable water because it's very important for the water to be very clean as it moves through the data center so as not to like gunk things up basically. But from what I can tell actually like there's not too much of a problem right now in converting fresh water to portable water and like there are actually economies of scale where if you're converting more of it like that can actually make it cheaper rather <124>
than more expensive. There's a lot of stuff to say about that. But another common thing that gets said is that AI is using drinking water and that sounds like a big emergency because obviously people need water to drink and stuff like that. And I think people have a really weird understanding of the relationship between drinking water and fresh water which is basically just like not salt water. And it's actually like the big constraint in a lot of areas is just how much access to fresh water people have and not so much how much access to like drinkable water people have because there can be times <125>
when economies of scale can kick in. And there's a lot of uncertainty about this. Like I want to flag that like I'm basically just some guy here who's done a lot of deep dives on this topic over the past few months. And so I'm reporting what I know to the best of my ability, but I'm not an expert. And if I you think I'm getting anything wrong, like please email me right away. Like that would be very embarrassing. But what I'm saying is based on just like a lot of reading and a lot of like individual ideas that each aren't actually super complicated but can be like confusing when you first bump <126>
into them basically. So like yeah a lot more to say about water but those are the like really useful categories to understand. &gt;&gt; So let's bottom line that again one more time. We got the three categories. A lot of what we're taking out to do this cooling can be put back. That's not without any issues. Um, what should I say at a party? &gt;&gt; Oh, so super quick. I will [laughter] go. Yeah. What should you say at a party? I will flag that most of the water that flows through data centers themselves actually does seem to be consumed where it's evaporated where like maybe 20% of it is returned <127>
to like local sources and stuff and sometimes a little bit polluted that needs to be treated. What should you say to the party? Okay, so my best guess right now is for like first of all I would just describe like consumptive versus non-conumptive use where if someone's like hey I uses half as much water as the UK I would say about 90% of that is withdrawn by power plants and then returned. So we're actually talking more about like 5% of the water that's actually consumed by the UK. like consumption is the big problem. That's like obviously withdrawal has some issues, but like the main thing I'm <128>
worried about is water that's not returned. And then within that, AI is like kind of a small percentage of that. Like my best guess right now is in 2023, and obviously a lot's changed since then, but this is the last time we have good data. My best guess is that I'm from a town of about 15,000 people. And in 2023, I'm pretty sure that AI in America used like 8 to 10 times as much water as my town used. And that's not nothing, but it's basically like spreading 10 towns of 15,000 people each all across America. And if you just ask like how big of a water problem would this be for the country, I don't <129>
actually think that would be a super big deal. Like it comes with some interesting planning problems, but like I usually keep in the back of my pocket like, oh, it's about this much. At least it was 2 years ago. And then I can talk about how much it's changing and how much it's going on. But like the two things I would say are yeah, like those water statistics, here's how much of it is actually consumed. And then within that consumption, how much is AI? Like maybe 20 to 30%. And how much does that compare to like just towns or like other things that are using water? And I kind of lose sight of <130>
like how clear this is to other people when I'm talking because I've been so in the weeds. So like if you want to rephrase that for yourself, that might be useful here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I'll do I I do think the comparison to towns and cities is really helpful. I've done that for myself a little bit more on the energy side. So maybe I'll do the energy and then you can try to do the water. It is pretty handy that the latest chips basically run a thousand watts as well. The H100 was like 700 watts. There's a little bit of extra, you know, kind of padding on top of that for the auxiliary things <131>
that also consume power at the data center. The, you know, bigger and better chips use a little bit more. They're getting a little bit more efficient. Not necessarily like a ton more efficient in terms of like flops per per energy. these days because a lot of the lowh hanging fruit there has been picked. But roughly speaking, we can still sort of round to a thousand watts per chip. So that notably is like the same as a home. And then you can kind of work that to these like big data center buildouts. So if somebody's going to do a gigawatt data center, that is a billion watts, which would be a million <132>
chips if each chip is at a thousand. And that would translate to basically a million homes worth of electricity. What I've seen from the Stargate plans, for example, is that they try are trying to get to 5 gawatt over, you know, a couple years of this buildout. So 5 gawatt would be 5 million chips or 5 million homes or a city of you know 5 million homes which would be maybe more like 10 12 million people something maybe around the order of magnitude of New York or Los Angeles which again is not small but is you know only singledigit percentage of the American population for one thing and as you <133>
noted earlier too is with electricity being like roughly a quarter of our emissions footprint. If you say okay well you know New York City is I don't know four or five depending on you know whatever metro area whatever you want to draw the line call it 5% call it 4% of the US overall footprint and then dial that down by the 25 only 25% of your overall emissions footprint is electricity in the first place you're basically saying Stargate in its full 5 gawatt buildout is roughly a 1% contribution to US emissions as they exist, you know, baseline. &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. A ton to say about this. I actually <134>
want to flag that now that we're talking about like big data center level stuff that like all the confidence I just had about the individual prompts, like I have way less confidence about like how much the data center buildout affects things. And like some people get a little bit confused by that because like isn't there some relationship there? I can go into details on like how I think about like how these individual prompts like contribute to the overall stuff and like why this is confusing and why it's not. And once we get into here, like I have to say like gigawatt data centers are just mind-blowing. <135>
It's crazy to think about buildings like just stepping back and being like, "Oh yeah, you know, a single building could use like a percentage point of America's household electricity." Like insane that's happening. Like that's just completely mind-blowing to me. So like a lot to think about here. And when it comes to this level, like at the individual prompt level, I'm not worried about electricity or water. At the global level, at the level of data centers, I think it's very clear that electricity is going to be the big challenge here. At least from the estimates that I've seen, very like even <136>
at the maximum amount of projected data center growth over the next few years, it seems like basically adding about like the water cost seems to be about like an additional 1% of America's irrigated corn, which again, it's not nothing. It's actually quite a bit, but like that's potentially like adaptable. Like the system can handle an increase at that size. But the electricity stuff is like orders of magnitude larger as a proportion of like America's total grid right now. Like that's going to be the huge challenge. And like there I'm a lot more uncertain about like oh you know like I could totally <137>
believe that this will be very bad for local environments. So I tend to say about that but yeah gigawatt data centers like yeah very useful comparison like each of these chips is effectively like a home or at least an apartment where yeah a thousand watts really great simple comparison to a home and it's like very convenient that it's around there because you can just do the like orders of magnitude multiples. So yeah a gawatt is something like a million homes worth of energy 5 gawatt 5 million homes like completely wild. So yeah, this is a place where I'm like, yeah, I don't know. I'm like quite <138>
worried about the local environmental effects of the electricity specifically. A ton to think about there, but yeah, that yeah, I'm shooting off in a lot of different directions here because I'm kind of a number as a baseline and just want to flag a ton of stuff. So yeah, that's a really great comparison between homes and like data center stuff. So how do you think about the I I guess we're basically if I had to summarize the conversation so far it's like at the very aggregate level we are looking at something like a low singledigit increase in emissions from AI even with the like mega projects <139>
that have been announced you know all kind of coming to fruition from a individual user standpoint point you almost can't get there. Like those visions are obviously predicated on a vision for the evolution of AI where you know it's going off and doing like longrunning autonomous science and like coming back with discoveries and it's sort of like working in the background for you non-stop. You know, how does one get to 10,000 prompts a day where you would be, you know, potentially using as much energy with AI as you are with like a daily commute? The answer is like, well, it's got to be just doing <140>
an unbelievable amount of stuff in the background for you, right? So, this is like a very different regime of AI use. And we're accounting for all of that when we say we're getting to kind of low single-digit percentage increase in emissions. And then water is even less. So, that's kind of okay, great. Now the next level of analysis that the concerned citizens you know including yourself would get to would be like okay well maybe that's true and by the way I would say just as a brief anecdote for myself the offset has been very real for me personally recently I've talked about this on another episode <141>
but my son currently has burkett lymphoma burket leukemia and I've used AI you know non-stop to try to help me understand what that is and you know are the doctors in thing and is there anything else we might be doing etc etc um okay how many prompts is that you know across and I do everything in triple also I'll go to JGBT and Gemini and you know Claude and sometimes even Grock although it's really the main three that I trust the most so even doing everything in triplicate you know I'm probably like a few hundred prompts over the last you know month worth of doing this maybe a thousand so I've <142>
still got like a long way to go even to like one cross town trip and I would really emphasize how much it has indeed saved me in the real world because the things that we were considering that the AI kind of helped us understand like we didn't really need to do were like maybe we should move our entire family to another city to you know take advantage of some other medical center that might you know have better care or another thing is because we had a again I talked about this in the other episode but like it just so happened that I had a possible issue of mold in my basement at the same time <143>
that my kid is going through this and you know is vulnerable to possible mold infection. So, I've got these kind of like, well, geez, what do I do about the fact that I might have mold in my house and my kids, you know, extra vulnerable to it. And I was able to with the help of AI analysis get comfortable with buying a few hepailters, putting them, you know, around my house. And I mean that does have its own energy cost which again probably trumps the the AI use by a lot but it's also still a lot cheaper than you know going out and renting some other house you know and having two you know heating <144>
heating my own house and living in another one you know and having two houses that I'm heating for the winter you know would be even another order of magnitude up easily. So I have personally in just the last month you know offset enough real world you know transporting of my family or like you know renting heating another house kind of stuff to basically pay for your and my like lifetime of you know at least like conventional prompting AI use if not necessarily the full you know Altman vision of like you know tons of agents working for you around the clock in the background but I think that part <145>
is like it is worth highlighting because I think it is kind of it can feel handwavy to people but you know like I've definitely lived the in a very concrete way that this has saved me from having to do you know dramatically more energy and resource intensive stuff and not obviously you know financially intensive as well. So the ROI and kind of every dimension there has been outstanding. Not even mentioning, you know, the impact that it's hopefully had in terms of reducing the, you know, the overall risk to my son's, you know, long-term well-being. So, so that's notable, but okay. So, let's get <146>
into the local stuff. Now, we've got these things are mega projects. No doubt about that. One, you know, big building or cluster of buildings might use as much as a million person city or, you know, you could even imagine that getting into a couple million people's worth of energy consumed at a particular site. One way I started to think about this is that I was just looking at like we can also maybe talk about what kinds of energy are used because that's going to change things a lot too. But and I get the sense that in the short term we're going to burn a lot more gas. In the medium term, we hope <147>
to have a lot more solar. We hope to have a lot more nuclear perhaps as well. I look at solar and I found that one gigawatt can be provided with basically 10 square miles of solar panels which is you know not a small area but then I looked at okay let's say that's one gawatt for you know you can get one gawatt powered for 10 square miles okay what if we go to the full 80 gawatt that is kind of projected as like the total usage of the, you know, the Grand Vision Alman's like 7 trillion buildout or whatever. Now you're going from 10ish square miles to let's say 800 square miles and that is still <148>
less than 1% of the land area of the state of Michigan where I live or the state of Nevada which is you know sunnier and much emptier although there's a lot of empty space everywhere. That's another thing that I think is like dramatically underappreciated. you know, the view from the cockpit of the plane is like just so much of the time is like there's just no, you know, no sign of civilization in front of you. The, you know, the cities are kind of these like relatively small things over the vast landscape. So if we can power all of the you know grand vision of the $7 trillion buildout 80 gawatt <149>
with less than 1% of the land area of either Michigan or Nevada. It seems like it's not like land use per se that is the problem. So how should we start to think about the impact in you know localities right? I mean there there obviously still is like well what about Memphis you know right by where the you know the Colossus thing is being built. What's happening there? You know is there something that's like unfairly locally concentrated that we should be more concerned about even if you know this like aggregate is all sounds fine. &gt;&gt; Oo yeah a ton to say about that. A lot of different directions. <150>
Wanted to circle back and just say that your story has been like really amazing to follow over the last few weeks by the way and so like just yeah really grateful that you're sharing so much and yeah obviously you're doing a ton. Yeah, the Memphis example actually brings up like the single thing that I'm most worried about by far as a environmental impact of data centers like you know kind of like a ranking in my head and like far and away I think the biggest threat that I'm worried about is air pollution like much more so than climate impacts as a whole. I can explain why they're much lower on <151>
my list much more so than water. land use gets really ridiculous where like America just has a lot of land honestly like and data centers are just so incredibly compact for what they're doing like it's just like if you think about the processes that are happening inside of them they're in some ways like miracles of compactness you know it's like Mo's law of the building or something like that it's crazy but yeah like with climate stuff I think that it seems very likely to me that most of the impacts that AI will have on the climate will be in how it's used not in the data centers itself and it <152>
seems very likely that there are just so many opportunities to reduce emissions using AI even just like you know this isn't a great example of like current AI but just like Google Maps like if you believe that Google Maps has reduced total car emissions on net by like a percent that's already a huge portion of all global data centers and that's like one app you know and so like but the thing about climate is that it's actually very funible so like if I emit one unit of carbon somewhere and reduce 10 units of carbon somewhere else like the harm is equally equivalent to me just removing 9 g of carbon, <153>
right? Because or 9 units of carbon because the impact of carbon is over the long term. It's not like an immediate bad thing. But air pollution is very different where it's just not funible in the same way where like if a nearby coal plant built a pipe directly into my home and we're like, "Oh, sorry. We did the math and like on net this will reduce air pollution as a whole even though it will make it much worse for you." I'd be like, "Well, that's not cool." You know, because like air pollution has immediate very bad health consequences. Something that really puts this into stark perspective is <154>
that like every year it seems like millions of people are dying from the effects of indoor air pollution especially. And this is more than like the WHO expect will die from climate change every year even into like the 2040s and the 2050s. And so like air pollution is actually already a much bigger disaster than climate change will be in the medium term anyway. And so like and in America like we have pretty clean air but there's still a lot of bad things that can happen and like it's just such a normalized part of our lives that I expect that like even if AI is just using the normal grid and is <155>
just like increasing a lot of like natural gas and some combination of that and renewables air pollution stuff actually seems like the biggest threat because like as a baseline it's already just very bad for us. Memphis I'm like very worried to comment on because like I really don't want to like get this wrong basically because it does seem like the local community reported that they were like literally smelling gas in the air. There was a lot of movement about this. There was recording of the Colossus using more gas turbines than they were permitted. I have to admit I just like don't know nearly <156>
as much about this as I should. There's a lot of contested stuff that happened. It does seem like the city has run a lot of tests since and like this is not a continuing problem but it might have been happening at the time. But again, like I I want to like quadruple check this before like making any big claims about this, but like it's illustrative of the broader point that like even if data centers operate as like just normal parts of the grid, like the normal grid is actually somewhat bad for us right now. And like that's often like that cost is often shifted to very poor like communities who <157>
live in like undesirable areas with like more air pollution as a baseline. like the area that Memphis, the Memphis data center was polluting already had like grade F air. It's just like a like obvious case of like how pollution is distributed. And if you look at the forecasts for AI, it's just like forecasted to use a lot of coal and a lot of natural gas at least into 2030 or so. And like there are all these complicating factors where it's also like there are all these agreements to buy like new renewable energy as well. And there can be these huge benefits to renewable energy from economies of <158>
scale there. And so the climate impacts get really uncertain for me where I'm like, you know, on net, this could actually be a benefit for the climate both in how it's used and in building out so much new renewables that economies of scale happen and they become cheaper overall. But air pollution I actually really worry about as like something that communities need to take really deathly seriously. And like this is actually the environmental impact I'm most worried about. Like water just doesn't seem to add up in most places. Like most places I've investigated, I just can't find a single place <159>
where it's impacted water access at all. A lot of people will immediately be up in arms if I say that because they've seen a lot of scary stories. My claim is that basically every scary story about water access doesn't really add up when you actually look at the numbers or is related to the construction of a data center rather than the normal operations. But and so I'm not really worried about water in the short term, but I am just pretty worried about the air pollution effects of a lot of additional gas and especially new coal plants opening up. Like that seems really bad. So like somewhere there's <160>
like, you know, I'm moderately worried about climate impacts, not really worried about water, and like there's a huge power gap where I'm like extremely worried about air pollution just because air pollution is just a very normalized, very bad thing in the country right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I've learned a little bit about air pollution and how bad it is for us over time. It seems like it is kind of like lead in the sense that you want basically as little as you can possibly get. &gt;&gt; Yeah. My sense about those the numbers that you let off with there in terms of like millions of people dying <161>
annually from indoor air pollution. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's different. I realize &gt;&gt; that's like people mostly like heating and cooking their homes with like wood fires in the home, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. On America, I can't get good numbers on how many people are dying from air pollution in America. But a lot of the estimates are really shocking and will range from like 30 to 100,000 people a year, which is like more than guns, you know, and it's like in the same range as cars and stuff and like, you know, it seems like it's pretty hard to actually understand the causality here. And it <162>
could be more and it could be less, but like you know, if this is, you know, I I get fired up a lot about how like, oh, you know, I'm excited about weight mode because 40,000 people die in cars each year and I'd like to at least automate that away. That would be really amazing. But like air pollution specifically just does seem by like any measure to be killing at least tens of thousands of people every year. And just like thinking about like oh well this building of like you know these new data centers contribute to additional deaths from air pollution like that is something I would really want <163>
communities to be really careful with and like that's the main way I'm like not really gung-ho about building these really massive data centers in around like vulnerable communities specifically. Yeah, a ton to say about that. And I'm like pretty agnostic about the specifics where I haven't done the deep dive on like exactly how bad it is to have like a gas turbine like a mile from you versus like a coal plant 10 miles away or something like that. But, you know, that's the main thing I would be concerned about. And in some ways, I like get quite frustrated by the water conversation for distracting <164>
so much from what I think is a much more serious issue. Do [snorts] we h how much do we know about like how much of that is a sort of threshold effect problem versus a you know should I do you have any advice for like you know everyday listeners who are like geez I hadn't thought about air pollution should they go buy &gt;&gt; he filters for their own homes you know what like how if you're just living in a place where you don't smell gas should you still be taking action on the margin to clean your own air more or I haven't really thought about this enough to comment. I know like I've read scary <165>
stories about how like back when toll booths were common. Like there were a disproportionate amount of like surprising negative health impacts of like people in toll booths standing next to idling cars so much. And so like I sometimes worry about just like being in a city with a lot of traffic specifically where like maybe that on its own is pretty bad. But I this is actually a place I haven't really done a deep dive. So like I don't know the exact thing. like basically just like maybe prioritizing the general quality of the air where you live actually probably matters a lot for your health. Besides <166>
that, it's not really something I know very much about honestly. So, I don't really want to comment too much. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's I do. One thing I think we'll never go back on probably is having upgraded to the highest quality filters that you can put into your furnace. We have just a central, you know, forced air furnace in the house. And, you know, those things do come out amazingly dirty after, you know, 8 weeks or whatever. They're in there. So, that seems like just off the top. You can see that there's, you know, some benefit to it. I think we'll stay top of the line on that. On the HEPA <167>
filters, it's interesting because it's like they also bring a noise pollution element, which, you know, there's a lot of, you know, sort of, I guess, no pun intended, but some increasing noise being made about the evils of noise pollution, too. So, I'm not sure how to think about trading those off, but at a minimum, the furnace filters are a no-brainer, it seems like. And then maybe having a couple HP filters around one's home is the kind of thing that would be a good, you know, kind of precautionary investment in one's long-term health. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's super interesting and it's <168>
kind of fun like it's just like evidence of how actually like interesting the AI environment conversation can be where it's like, oh, by the way, hepailters, you know, like it just bleeds into so many other things that can be pretty interesting. The what was I going to say? I do also worry a lot in these conversations that in purely focusing on the negatives and like I'm not really trying to bracket off like air pollution here like air pollution is uniquely bad but like assuming that a data center contributes minimal air pollution and we think instead about noise pollution. I do worry that by the <169>
time we get down to noise pollution, a lot of the positives of the data center might not be being considered where I kind of think about a data center as like a new huge taxable industry in an area. And like a lot of people will talk about how like oh so many parts of America are in decline and the people are having so much trouble because industry left, you know, and like a lot of those industries were also sometimes noisy, you know, like if there was a factory near you, like you would probably sometimes hear noise pollution and stuff. And so like now when new data centers are being built, they <170>
just often contribute so much to the local tax base and can sometimes help the economy in other ways too that I don't want to say they're always good, but I do sometimes worry that people will be like, "Oh, maybe they contribute millions of dollars a year to the town, but oh, they make some noise, you know?" And I'm like, "Well, this would have pre prevented us from building factories and stuff too back in the day and the town would have really never got off its feet in the first place." So, like I'm very happy to go into the like nitty-gritty of like what about land use? What about noise? What <171>
about these other kind of weird aspects of data centers, but I do worry that at that point we're starting to lose the forest for the trees and stuff like that and not consider like, oh yeah, there's a trade-off to be made here. Like, this introduces some new noise pollution and you get like a million dollars a year in tax revenue for your town or something like that. And like, is the trade-off worth it? Like I would say so in a lot of cases like obviously with the consent of the people around it but like yeah definitely important to consider the positives as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean another <172>
thing that makes noise is neighbors. You know I've got [laughter] to run their lawnmowers during the day and you know have a leaf blower or whatever &gt;&gt; and it's like yeah nothing's quieter than a ghost town. So that doesn't in the limit that doesn't really work. &gt;&gt; How about just the sort of energy cost to the consumer? I think one of the big complaints we're hearing now also is this is going to jack up the cost of everybody's electricity and that's not fair and I think there's at least something to be said for that. So I guess maybe a two-part question would be like how big of a deal <173>
is that? What have we seen so far? And then maybe you could sort of play like policy advi. It seems like at the macro level of policy you'd be like build do the AI buildout is it kind of sounds like your mainline recommendation. It'll probably have enough offset. it'll probably work. But then there's the local policy level of like, okay, what if you were advising the, you know, Memphis, you know, whatever city council there, they have more particular concerns around these like water, land, air pollution, noise pollution sort of issues. So, how much of a issue have we seen in like electricity bills? <174>
And how would you advise the local decision makers that are like, you know, everybody wants to get, you know, these industry investments? The companies are often pretty good at playing jurisdictions off against one another. Like where would you say, okay, you know, hold the line here for your people to make sure you're getting a good deal, you know, versus like, you know, what can you accept that, you know, maybe you give some ground on because again, it might just be worth it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like going into the electricity thing for a second. The again the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <175>
who are just like some of my favorite sources on data center stuff. They just produce a lot of really good work. They had produced a general report at least very strongly implying that almost all of the recent increases in electricity costs at the average national level anyway seemed to be due to mostly inflation downstream effects of inflation and a few other bumps like there was a point where like you know the war in Ukraine was raising gas prices for a little while and stuff like that. I can't really figure out exactly what's going on, but the general overview takeaway seems like the a lot of <176>
the cause of increased average electricity prices at the national level in the past 5 years has been like been caused entirely by issues with supply rather than demand. And so even though we've added a lot of additional energy demand, data centers don't seem to have contributed to that rise. Like so there's this common statistic going around right now that since 2020 the average American electricity bill has risen by 35%. And from what I can tell data centers don't seem to have contributed at all to that 35% rise. Like a huge amount of it is just inflation. When you factor out inflation the rest <177>
seems to be a combination of a few weird issues with supply. And I'm deferring here to the report itself. The report's making these claims and I'm just trying to summarize it and doing a good job there. So at the national level it's it doesn't seem to be an issue. There have definitely been local places where utilities have come out and said we have had to raise electricity rates because of the data center. I haven't found anywhere that they've done that with water yet. I could be wrong but with electricity that's definitely happened. Um there's a whole like separate weird debate to be had about <178>
this where it's like oh maybe we need to like pressure utilities to do more buildouts of infrastructure anyway for the green energy transition. And so like they maybe don't want to but we have to pay higher electricity bills for the green energy transition anyway because electrifying anything everything is going to require huge amounts of new green energy but also maybe data centers eat up too much of that and like they're like very zero sum altogether and don't actually add too much to that process. There's so many unknown unknowns here that's very hard to talk about too much and I don't feel <179>
fully equipped to diagnose it. But basically like I think there are definitely places where data centers have so far affected electricity prices. I think they're pretty overblown in that most of those price rises have come from these other things. But this could al change in the future as well, just because data centers are projected to use such a massive amount of new energy in America. One other complicating factor here is that from what I can tell, American total electricity use over the next 5 years will definitely rise significantly, primarily driven by data centers, also a few other things <180>
like the electrification of cars and stuff. But this rise will actually be slower than it has been in the past. We were in this really weird state from like 2008 to the present or until like 2021 or so where electricity consumption in America was mostly staying flat because we both optimized a lot of things and also just shifted more to a commercial economy and so we lost industry and as a result used less total electricity and so total American electricity use is rising for the first time since like the financial crisis basically. And this is a weird new situation for us to be in in the short <181>
term, but in the long term, it's actually projected to rise less than it did historically from like 1950 to the year 2000 or something like that. And so I think we have it in us to manage that honestly. Like the big difference here is that now we really don't want to be building a ton of new fossil fuels, which no, we didn't really know in the 1960s or whatever. And so it's going to be harder to do that as we build out green energy, but not impossible. And as that rise happens, it seems like manageable to keep bills low, but also data centers are so much more concentrated compared to other sources <182>
of demand. So like I have to throw my hands up and say I don't really know. And there are a lot of people smarter than me who have looked into this a lot more who are pretty concerned about future electricity bills rising a lot. One like very last note is that there's this funny thing that I think a lot of people have this bad misconception where like if demand for electricity goes up in your region, your electricity costs stay higher forever. And that's not actually the case at all because that would imply that very large cities would always have higher electricity bills than very rural areas. <183>
And like what's actually happening is that there's a lot of like economies of scale happening where like as more demand comes online, there's a temporary increase in cost, but over time that can level out. But another thing that's happening that's weird is that like data center demand might just keep going up and up and up and not give grids enough time to catch up. And so we might be facing very long periods of higher electricity bills to fund the like continuous buildout to support data centers. So like it's really fascinating. It's like one of the most interesting topics I've ever scraped up <184>
against, which is how the American energy grid is actually going to deal with this. And I'm kind of left like first of all believing that like people actually have a surprising lack of understanding of what's actually causing electricity bills to rise and fall. Like even experts disagree about this a lot. And yeah, the future is just so wildly uncertain. I will say that like I'm very agnostic about whether we should do the AI buildout in general because you know I'm excited about AI but you know you know I want to maximize the benefits and minimize the risk and stuff and like I'm totally open to <185>
there being a huge amount of risk involved in this for like the uses of AI. So yeah, I just want to flag that. And then like finally, one last thing is that like at the community level, I actually don't feel like I have enough knowledge to give to specific communities on this outside of like do a full thorough analysis of the pluses and minuses here. Like don't just look at the fact that the data center uses water at all. Like also consider like the tax revenue and the utility revenue and like there are some cases where using water is actually good because it gives the utility more revenue to upgrade <186>
aging pipes and stuff like that. and like really push for renewable energy if you can and build out like battery stuff and like maybe pressure utility to build out a lot of high transmission stuff anyway. But this is all very handwavy like this is like I'm kind of just some totally just some guy on this so I don't want to speak more confidently on this one thing than I am. &gt;&gt; So to try to bottom line a couple things there. One is if there's a concern about the macro AI buildout, it's the macro issues of controlling the AI long term, not the the marginal emissions. locally there can be a lot <187>
of issues, but the, you know, it seems like maybe what we need for sort of the general protection of the population is some sort of federal standard, you know, and not to invoke the impossible, but like it it seems like we do have a challenge where, you know, we saw this with like Amazon with its second headquarters famously, you know, all these sorts of things where even just pro sports teams, you know, build us a stadium, we'll go to some other city that will build us a stadium. We do have a problematic dynamic where companies will they have direct incentive and often they do choose to locate <188>
themselves in the jurisdiction that will give them the most breaks and the least you know obligations. And so it does seem like we are probably headed for at least instances of local governments making deals with companies where they effectively raced to the bottom in terms of what protections they insisted on for their local populations ultimately leading to what might not be a great deal for those local populations. But the real solution to that seems to be we need some sort of you know cooperate equilibrium to be established or if not equilibrium you know maybe some sort of you know higher level <189>
rule to just insist that like certain things get paid back into the community or you know get remediated so that you know whoever's living in the area isn't breathing bad air. That seems like there's enough surplus to go around for it for sure. It's just a question of I mean I don't mean to dismiss this because this is always the case, right? It's like the same was said about the China shock in the first place or that you know that left a lot of towns that are now looking for new industry in a bad place. Well, sure you you know the aggregate welfare goes up. You can always redistribute. Is that <190>
effectively going to happen? It hasn't always. Some might say it hasn't, you know, in most cases. So, we face that same challenge again. But it seems like the bottom line on kind of all these resource dimensions and even the sort of pollution externality dimensions is the surplus is definitely there for it. If we want to take one big takeaway, it's like, let's get our act together this time and actually make sure that we do insist on, you know, reasonable standards or, you know, get the right compensation for people that are, you know, directly locally affected. And if we do that, we should be <191>
fine. And it seems like it still shouldn't be so much that it would like see the AI race to China or you know prevent us from like being able to use all the chat bots and AI agents and you know for that matter image and video generation models that we could possibly want. But the local political economy of this can be problematic if we're not careful about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a funny, this is something else that like I worry doesn't always come through where I feel like I'm often writing in response to the most extreme takes about data centers where people will write implying that like it is <192>
literally always bad to use water on data centers. I'm like, well, here are all these trade-offs. In a lot of America, it is good to use more water because economies of scale happen and the main access problem is like aging infrastructure and not raw access to fresh water. But in doing that, I often like don't also stake out that like, yeah, I'd like a lot more like rigorous environmental regulations on this stuff like with the goal of doing a green energy build out, you know, like there's another nuance you can get into where it's like, oh, certain environmental regulations can actually stifle <193>
the types of builds that we need for like green energy and stuff like high transmission, long distance power and stuff. A lot to get into there. Yeah. And the race to the bottom thing is interesting too where it's definitely a huge problem. Like you read about how like people are just delaying taxes on data centers for longer and longer periods of time, other things and like people will talk about this but then in the same breath be like oh and there's no benefit to communities anyway and like my question is always like well if there's a race to the bottom like why are all these city governments <194>
racing in the first place you know and like a big part of it is that like there are some tangible benefits you know to having a data center like all else equal like you know I'm from like like I grew up pretty well off personally But I'm from like a not super well-off area that is in some ways like left behind by like industry and stuff. And like I think I would be actively excited if like a medium-sized data center were built in the vicinity that the town could then tax and use for stuff. Like I think that would be net good personally, but there are a lot of other places where I would probably <195>
be much more hesitant, especially like a super large data center that was going to build like you know a huge amount of gas turbines everywhere. And so, yeah, I'd be personally pretty excited about a lot of very specific targeted regulation that prevented like air from being polluted in significant ways, but didn't like prevent like the types of, you know, otherwise like grid upgrades that we need for the green energy transition. Anyway, again, you know, this I'm kind of a hobbyist here, so like I'm not speaking from a position of authority, but like yeah, I think my general ask for most people <196>
considering this is like even in like race to the bottom dynamics, like it's kind of important to just consider like what are the actual trade-offs here? Is this worth it? like definitely say no. Like I don't think that data centers should be built everywhere, but just like it's important to consider the positives and the negatives as opposed to just deciding that like because they don't see any value in AI, like it shouldn't be able to use any of the community's water because there are a lot of instances where even if the thing inside the data center is useless, like it can actually sometimes <197>
have positive effects on the local community. &gt;&gt; Are there any rules of thumb that you could venture around like who should not build a data center? I mean, one one candidate would be like, if water is already really scarce in your &gt;&gt; area, like maybe you're not a good candidate for a data center. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. I have a really crazy take on the water stuff actually, which is that like I think that data centers are actually like quite good candidates for very water scarce areas like Maricopa in Arizona. So like a lot of new data centers are being built around the Phoenix area. And <198>
you might think like this is ridiculous. You know, Phoenix is a city built in a desert, but there are a lot of other industries and commercial buildings that use a lot more water than data centers do. So, like the the golf courses around Phoenix, from what I can tell, use something like 30 times as much water or like the golf courses in the state of Arizona overall might use like 30 times as much water as all data centers in Arizona. And like that on its own is pretty crazy to me that there are these like, you know, golf course. I don't know if you've ever been to that area specifically, but it's <199>
like kind of eerie to like stumble on this like sickly sweet green in like the middle of a desert, you know? And like if these industries are using water, the difference between them and data centers is that data centers are often generating way more tax revenue per gallon of water used. Like best I can tell right now is that like if you add up the total like tax revenue and water used from both golf and data centers in Arizona like data centers are generating something like 50 times as much revenue per gallon used. And so like basically thinking about it like if you want like I wouldn't support <200>
additional water being used in Arizona, but I would definitely support like less effective industries being swapped out for data centers. Like if I could like close all the golf courses in Arizona and replace them all with data centers in the state, like that would just generate billions of dollars in revenue for the state without increasing the water bills at all. And so like because data centers generate so much revenue per gallon used, at least right now, like they actually seem like surprisingly good candidates for the desert. But you know, a lot to say about that. I definitely don't want to <201>
increase water use more there than it already is. Yeah. I don't know. Besides that, like main rule of thumb is just like I'd really like it just seems really preferable to not build data centers near where you have to open new coal plants or keep coal plants running to operate them. Like coal is just so bad for people's health and for the climate that like that seems good. Beyond that though, like I don't have any clear rules of thumb. It's not to say I wouldn't object to more specific cases. It's just it's kind of hard to think about on a case- by case basis and I haven't really developed an overarching <202>
like oh here's the like Andy strategy and it seems a little bit goofy because like all of this started with me like wanting to win arguments at parties about using chat bots and I've like escalated to here's my complete plan for the data center build out you know and at some point I have to step back and be like I don't know like I kind of trust like people who've been thinking about the very local ecologies of these regions and the local economics and stuff to like know enough to make good decisions here. I think I'm just like in general like somewhat differential to like local experts. &gt;&gt; <203>
Yeah. Well, I would say you know the world is grappling with this in real time for one thing. So one of my big themes of this overall journey of making this show is like there AI is intersecting with everything and we need people to kind of step into these niches you know whether they started in a particular niche or are kind of jumping into it based on you know even a motivation as you know as pedestrian as being annoyed by you know stupid stuff other people are saying. It is it is important that people kind of take ownership of like figuring out different corners of this whole phenomenon. So <204>
I applaud you for doing that and I would say you know obviously all more expertise and you know more local knowledge always good but we are kind of moving very quickly into this and I think you've definitely done the overall discourse of service by you know piping up in many times in many places with more grounded analysis than we're otherwise typically getting. And then yeah I mean I guess the local stuff is I'm glad we got to golf you know because that was another one that I was really marveling at. Um, I was looking at LA area golf courses and again this is sort of these like giant numbers. <205>
One thing I did want to double click on for a second is like are we using the same meaning of use when we talk about use water? Like I've seen an LA golf course uses 90 millions of 90 million gallons of water a year or LA area golf courses plural is like 1.6 billion gallons per year estimated. That's like a ridiculous number and it dwarfs, you know, like what it took to train GPT3 and, you know, things like this. But are we talking about the same use because those like sort of seep back into the ground, right? Or are they the I can't tell. Is that the same or different? &gt;&gt; This is where I <206>
start to scrape up against some issues here. Yeah, I have to admit like that I'm not an expert on, so I don't want to comment on too closely. Yeah, it is. I mostly do try to stick to like places where water is being actively chosen to be delivered by people. So like I don't count I try not to count rainwater as an example. So like if crops are mainly relying on rain water that would otherwise just be falling into the ground like you can say that crops are using that but it's like different. And so at least for agriculture I mainly focus on like irrigated agriculture specifically. And I have to <207>
admit I don't know too much about the water dynamics of like how this like eventually flows back. So I would have to like circle back on this. They're like you know this is a autodidact curse that you're bumping up against where you know like I know a lot about the specific water that is being delivered to these places but like whether this counts ultimately as consumption or withdrawal is a little bit beyond me and like what the difference is and how big of a deal it is. There there was one other yeah one other important difference here is that the water used in dated centers themselves like I <208>
said is portable whereas a lot of water delivered to like crops or golf courses is just like fresh water but like sometimes it's portable as well so like that's an important difference to keep in mind as well and but like it just doesn't seem too costly to turn fresh water portable based on my understanding like there's an initial upfront infrastructure cost of like a water treatment plant but yeah a lot of unknowns there like I wish I had a better answer there was a good question I think like in general The singular like really weird way that we use water that I would like more people to know <209>
about is like irrigated alphalfpha farms which like again I'm not entirely sure how this eventually flows back into the system but they seem to use something like a thousand times as much as all AI used in 2023 and there are a lot of like irrigated alphalfpha farms like in Arizona and other places too where these are also just like blooming in deserts and they're most a lot of alphalfpha is used to feed animals which we then eat you know so like I I'm biased here because I'm against animal agriculture for like animal welfare reasons, but like this is another place where like if we're going to focus <210>
on one water bad guy in the country, I would like to start with like the bizarre amount of irrigated alalfa we have and all the corn that is eventually converted into ethanol that we then use for gas where maybe we could use something else instead. Strong recommendation like Hank Green recently did like a big video on data center AI water stuff that I thought was just like masterful. Like I definitely disagreed with some of the ways that he hedged and some of the specific things he said, but like for the most part it was like some of the best single media I've ever seen about it anyway. And like <211>
he talks a lot about corn there and like how goofy it is that we use corn, how like goofy it is that we use so much water on our lawns every year and like he just puts things into a lot of like really useful context too. So if people are looking for like more of a deep dive on the water stuff, like that's probably like the best single resource to start with. So yeah, we definitely start there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cool. Just to fill in a little bit of the detail on food, since you'd mentioned animal agriculture, I had GBT in the background answer the question. How much energy/e emissions goes into the <212>
production of a hamburger? And the answer comes back at a few kilowatt hours of primary energy and a few kilograms of CO2 equivalent. So the if we just again kind of do a energy to energy quick conversion let's say it's 2,00 kilwatt hours that would be running your microwave for 2 hours 3600 seconds in an hour you're talking you know 7200 seconds in two hours and we already previously established one chatbot prompt is worth about a second of a microwave. though we get again to a sort of comical ratio of something like 5 to 10,000 chatbot queries for one hamburger. And by the way, the exact same <213>
number came back with the question of how much for a hot shower. So again, 5 to 10,000 ChBT queries for one hot shower. totally forgotten if I've already like shared the story, but a friend was in a pizza place like a few weeks ago and overheard two teenagers talking and one of them had said like, "Oh, this mutual friend of ours uses Chachi BT, so it's ridiculous that she calls herself an environmentalist." And then she immediately went and like ordered a meatlover's pizza specifically. [laughter] And like this is kind of just like sums up a lot of the debate here for me where I worry that in hyperfocusing <214>
so much on this like people are really losing sight of where the big environmental bad guys are. They're not where you'd expect. A lot of them in your personal life are probably going to involve like very different things like maybe the food that you eat. But even there like you know I'm mostly like not eating animal products for like animal welfare reasons. And I have to admit that like if someone's eating like a chicken sandwich around me, like I actually think that like it uses more resources than like some of the things that I eat. But even there, I actually like don't want to litigate the <215>
small amounts of like environmental harm. Like usually if I wanted to talk to them about it, I'd be like, "Oh, that was a little guy who had a really bad time, you know, in his life and like try to talk more about the animal welfare thing." And I think like saying like, "Oh, and it uses this many like tofu slabs or something. actually kind of dilute the point worth of energy. I mean that would kind of dilute the point that I'm making and like I think one other theme of a lot of my writing is that I'm quite concerned about most other aspects of AI. Like you know I love it and fear it like current <216>
chat bots are great. I'm very worried about like the consequences of even very near-term AI and I'm pretty worried that a lot of my fellow AI critics and warriors are like potentially diluting a lot of the points that they make by just adding on like oh this thing could make surveillance so much more effective and every time it does that it uses like a drop of water. Isn't that terrible? Like the second point just takes away from the first, I think, in a way that I think a lot of people are kind of missing. And so a big background motivation here isn't to say like, oh, everything's fine. Data center's <217>
built out is fine. Like you don't have anything to worry about. It's more to say that like I'd really like us to focus on these actual things and not just like throw everything we have at AI because I think like people who are listening to us notice very fast when you're just kind of reaching for any tool that you can to attack something as opposed to actually building up like like actual legitimate criticisms that you're really worried about. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Another way to put that I guess is in terms of contribution to overall pdoom the climate change contribution of AI is very minimal. &gt;&gt; <218>
Yeah. Yeah. And potentially even positive like again I like the International Energy Agency projects that by 2035 like all AI applications might together be like preventing something like four times as many emissions as all data centers cause. And that's wildly uncertain for a lot of different reasons. And another weird thing about that is that will mostly rely on deep learning models that aren't the big chat bots that are being powered in these huge data centers. So a lot of handwavy stuff to say about that. But like I think like the existence of AI in the short term like reduces my odds of like <219>
severe climate change by like a little bit but like also increases the worry in a lot of other ways. And like other environmental stuff like air pollution I do take seriously. Yeah, I'm really glad you mentioned that point about non LLMs or non-generalpurpose models driving a lot of value. I mean, I think that's something the world would do well to keep in mind in general, but specifically on this resources point, it's always really striking to me how small some of the models that are driving breakthrough contributions to various fields of science actually are. one I did an episode not long ago <220>
with Professor Jim Collins who has discovered new antibiotics with models that are just like I forget exactly how small they are but I think we're talking millions of parameters you know tens of thousands of data points like super small stuff that they can run on you know a couple computers in like a couple days time and you get new antibiotics out of it it's like okay this is a big deal the similar things probably are going to start to happen with material science, you know, with just all sorts of optimizations. You know, one one thing we had kind of touched on a little bit in preparing for this <221>
is just like optimizing energy use in buildings, you know, there's so much waste all over the place, right? That you could just get smarter about some of these kind of core operations and get a ton of value from there. But then you when you get into material science, I mean, then you really can move, you know, the sort of fundamentals of energy in a significant way. And you know literally like one material science breakthrough you know could very plausibly offset like all the you know all the inference that the world is going to use. So yeah exactly like especially material science for like batteries <222>
and like solar panels like there have already been some really exciting like photovoltaic improvements like enabled in part by AI anyway and like that on its own like the scale of that could like just start to dwarf a lot of what happens in data centers specifically. It's just like another obvious example where like computing is just so wildly efficient per task. Basically, it's like comically optimized. Like I'd run some like kind of goofy back of the envelope calculation where I'm pretty sure that to like run a game of Minecraft in 1950 would have required like half the energy of the United States <223>
and now it can run in your computer. You know, like I think people really underestimate just how much energy has been optimized in computers in the last 70 years or so. And because it's just so wildly optimized, just like what you're getting out of it is just going to have so much more effect on the world than the actual energy that went into it. And like the big hold up to this case is that like a lot of people believe that chat bots are still like completely useless and are going to be the main things in data centers. And so like if you're still in that camp and like you don't believe that chatbots <224>
will ever have any value, then like my case becomes more tenuous. But like I do just I have to put my chips in and be like man like chatbots are like a miracle to me. like I'm sure they're adding quite a bit of value and changing a lot of my behavior outside of like the computer itself. So like I think that for anyone who is very worried about the environment in AI like just all the game is going to be in the way that AI is used and not necessarily in the data centers itself and like worried about specific consequences of data centers but like framing the debate around like the energy used in data <225>
centers does feel disturbingly similar to me to like seeing Amazon take off and thinking oh I should mainly worry about how much energy the website's using. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe one kind of final point of comparison and then invite your kind of closing thoughts. But it does touch on this, you know, how AI is going to be used. Obviously, you know, there were some confidence bars around these estimates, but again, 80 gawatt seems to be the sort of grand vision, you know, with the Stargate project being 5 gawatt of that and, you know, imagining the full $7 trillion buildout, whatever. That's kind <226>
of come in at 80 gawatts in the analysis and estimates that I've run. Compare that to total global energy use today is estimated at 6,000 gawatt, which kind of backs out when we talked about like 1 gawatt being a million people. Then, you know, 1,000 gawatts could be like a billion people. That's like at US energy levels. 6 gawatts would be like 6 billion people. There's the sort of electricity to non-ele electricity conversion factor there, but roughly speaking, that seems like a order of magnitude reasonable estimate. So we're talking basically about like a little bit more than 1% increase. And <227>
another thing to keep in mind is that is almost certainly going to be dominated by the increase in energy use in the developing world by the just general background process of people getting wealthier, people being able to afford more energy. And like you know that's something that I think certainly I do not begrudge you know the global poor for their like marginal energy use over the coming decades. Maybe some do, but like I I certainly want to go on record saying like I think it's good when people can, you know, do more stuff and have better lives. So I don't know if there is any downside scenario <228>
that you think would be worth worrying about in terms of like how it's going to be used. We've kind of focused on the rosy side. I mean, one other short version super compressed would be like if AI makes everyone richer and then we can all afford more energy. you know, maybe there's just a lot more energy used broadly, but is there anything more specific that you think would be the kind of surprising, you know, possibly negative story in the macro sense? &gt;&gt; I mean, like I can get into really goofy sci-fi scenarios where it's like, oh, you know, if there's some like global war over AGI, which <229>
like I don't actually put super strong probability on, but I'm like, oh, you know, like very powerful AI systems in the future maybe destabilizes things. like nuclear war is bad for the environment. So that's something like at the edge cases it just gets really ridiculous. So I don't want to like go quite that far. So I'll bracket that for now and just say that like AI can probably reduce a lot of emissions. It does seem like there are a lot of potential ways it could really radically increase how much energy we use as well that might just make the green energy transition harder. like super optimized <230>
chopping apps might just make it much more tempting to buy more stuff or just like economic like making manufacturing more efficient in some ways might make us like use a lot more energy in total without transitioning that to green energy. I also do want to like make it clear that I'm also coming from like a very spec specific perspective of like it is definitely important to get the poorest people in the world a lot more access to energy basically by any means. And like when I talk about like cuts to emissions, I'm mainly talking about for people like us and like global very wealthy communities <231>
in comparison like just motivated a lot by like very much not like a Growth person as an example. So yeah, a lot to say about that. I'm trying to think about Yeah, I don't know. Even just like self-driving cars, like I could see a world where like that just makes driving much more tempting because suddenly like a 5-year-old kid can take a selfdriving car to like their friend's house if the parents okay it or something like that. And it just opens up so much additional travel that like on net that creates a lot more energy use. And like it's a funny world where like both like the like value we're <232>
getting per energy will probably be way higher because we'll have all these nifty gadgets and stuff, but like if that doesn't come with like a the green energy transition specifically, like we'll still be emitting more on net and like ultimately the climate only cares about the total amount of CO2 that's in the air. And so like I don't know like this all just feels so speculative and weird where I'm like oh yeah AI could like radically reduce car trips but maybe increase it and like reduce you know like building stuff but also like or decrease building energy use but also increase it elsewhere <233>
or like material science for green energy is good but like certain scientific discoveries for the military might make global war more likely. It starts to get really hand wavy really fast. Basically there are a lot of really cool papers on this. I could maybe like I know the I'm pretty sure it was the London School of Economics that recently published one that was really good. Yeah, there are a lot of cool like speculative stuff about this, but it's so uncertain that like if environmentalists are going to really focus on this, like I'd really want them on as like soldiers in the battle to make <234>
sure that like the way AI is used is good for the environment and data centers definitely worry about but don't treat them as the big central part central part of the story. &gt;&gt; I think that's probably a good place to leave it unless you want to bottom line it any other way for us. Um, yeah, basically that was super comprehensive. Thank you. That was a blast. So, just enjoy the conversation a lot. Yeah. Again, just big fan of the show.
