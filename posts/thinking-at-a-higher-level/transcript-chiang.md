Published August 12, 2025 by Carrie Ruddick and CDH Team

## Overview

As part of Princeton's Center for Digital Humanities' tenth-anniversary "Humanities for AI" initiative, renowned science fiction author Ted Chiang visited campus on March 18 to discuss his essay published in *The New Yorker* titled "Why A.I. Isn't Going to Make Art."

## Key Questions and Responses

### Humanities for AI's Purpose

Chiang frames the endeavor as countering capitalism's tendency to reduce everything to economic extraction. He argues that "Humanities for AI" seeks to redirect powerful technology toward purposes beyond profit maximization.

### Speculative Fiction's Influence on AI Development

While science fiction hasn't directly shaped generative AI, Chiang notes that broader AI discourse was influenced by futurist concepts. Specifically, Vernor Vinge's singularity concept influenced the Extropian community of the 1990s, which then impacted AI research. He observes that Silicon Valley now treats fictional scenarios as factual claims.

### AI's Role in Creative Writing

Chiang expresses skepticism about generative AI benefiting serious writers. Writing requires minimal technological overhead compared to filmmaking, so AI offers limited advantages. He compares potential AI-assisted creative writing to scanography—a valid but niche artistic practice.

### Student Use of Generative AI

Chiang provides direct guidance to students, explaining that essay writing serves as cognitive training. Using ChatGPT undermines education's purpose by enabling students to avoid the mental exertion necessary for intellectual growth.

### Meaningful Recent Work

Chiang highlights the television series *ANDOR*, praising its craft and its sophisticated examination of fascism resistance, noting its complexity exceeds typical science fiction narratives.
