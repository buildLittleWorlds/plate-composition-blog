      <h2>Nobody Hired You Because You Needed Work</h2>
      <p class="meta">February 18, 2026 · Responding to: <a href="https://blt279.github.io/TheDeathoftheBlue-CollarBackbone.html">Ben Teismann's "The Death of the Blue-Collar Backbone"</a></p>

      <p>Ben's essay argues that AI-driven autonomous trucking prioritizes corporate profit over workers, destroys middle-class stability, and accelerates rural decline. It frames automation as a choice to favor capital over people, not as an inevitable development.</p>

      <p>The essay is thoughtful and serious. But it rests on an unstated assumption that changes the whole argument: that the trucking industry exists, in some meaningful sense, to provide jobs to truck drivers.</p>

      <p>That is not how jobs work. That is not how any job works.</p>

      <h3>Three Small Examples</h3>

      <p>I teach AI literacy to middle and high school students through a program called Youth Horizons. Some parents wanted their kids to learn AI. An organization connected that demand with someone who could meet it. They found me. If those parents later chose a better option, no one would say I had been wronged. The arrangement was never about my right to that income. It was about a need and my ability to meet it.</p>

      <p>A taco truck shows up outside a construction site because workers get hungry at lunch and there is nowhere else to eat. If the project ends and the crew moves on, nobody says those workers owe the taco truck six more months of purchases. The truck goes where demand is.</p>

      <p>It snows, and a teenager with a shovel knocks on doors. Demand appears, someone meets it. When the snow melts, no one owes that kid continued work. If a homeowner buys a snowblower, the kid was not robbed. He is just no longer the best answer to that problem.</p>

      <p>In each case, the logic is simple: a need exists, someone fulfills it, and when the need goes away or is met differently, the arrangement ends.</p>

      <h3>The Assumption in the Essay</h3>

      <p>Scale the same logic up. Shippers need goods moved from point A to point B. Trucking companies exist to satisfy that demand. They hire drivers because human drivers are currently the way to do that work.</p>

      <p>Ben's essay often treats automation as something corporations are taking from drivers, as if the job belonged to the driver in the first place. But the job was always transactional: someone needed freight moved, and the driver was the best available way to move it. If that need can be met another way, the transaction changes.</p>

      <p>Every major claim in the essay depends on the opposite premise: that the trucking system exists to employ truckers. It does not. It exists to move freight. Drivers were the answer for one era. They may not be in the next one.</p>

      <h3>What This Does Not Mean</h3>

      <p>This does not mean displacement is painless. It is not. It can be brutal. Families lose income. Communities lose local spending. Identity and dignity can take a real hit when a trade disappears.</p>

      <p>But those harms do not prove workers had a claim on a specific task forever. They prove we need better transition systems: retraining that actually works, wage insurance, mobility support, and serious regional investment where work is being automated away.</p>

      <p>In other words, the moral argument is not "preserve this exact job no matter what." The moral argument is "people should not be abandoned when economic structures change."</p>

      <h3>Where the Moral Claim Belongs</h3>

      <p>If the claim is that autonomous trucking creates concentrated gains and distributed losses, I agree. If the claim is that policy should force winners to share those gains with displaced workers, I agree with that too.</p>

      <p>But if the claim is that companies are obligated to keep paying humans for work machines can do better simply because those humans need income, that claim fails. Nobody hired anyone because they needed work. They hired them because a demand existed and they were the best way to meet it.</p>

      <p>That distinction matters, because once we see it clearly, we can stop asking the wrong question ("How do we freeze jobs in place?") and ask the right one ("How do we protect people while the structure of work changes?").</p>
